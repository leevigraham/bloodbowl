<h5>Inducements in Exhibition Play</h5>
<p>Because all of the gold pieces in the Team Draft Budget must be spent when drafting a team for exhibition play, it is most uncommon that teams will be of different values. Therefore, when a team is drafted for exhibition play, you may spend as much or as little of your Team Draft Budget as you wish on Inducements, provided your team contains the minimum of 11 players, not including Induced Star Players. Inducements purchased in this way should be recorded on the Team Draft list.</p>
<p>If two coaches are drafting teams for exhibition play between themselves, they should take a few minutes to discuss Inducements first. It is important to decide if there are any Inducements they feel should be included or any they would prefer to leave out.</p>
<p>Tournament organisers should decide which, if any, Inducements will be allowed and ensure this information is passed on to participants.</p>
<h5>Player Advancement in Exhibition Play</h5>
<p>Unlike games played in a league, exhibition games are not linked. Therefore players will not have the opportunity to earn and spend Star Player points in the same way. However, teams drafted for exhibition play should include more than just rookies â€“ having a few players with an extra Skill or two makes for a more interesting game. To allow for this, exhibition teams are granted a number of SPP to distribute between players, meaning that some players can be given advancements when the team is drafted.</p>
<h6>Free SPP</h6>
<p>How many SPP coaches have to distribute between their players varies. For example, you could grant each team 36 SPP to spend on advancements; this is a fair number and allows a good selection of advancements across a team. However, this is only a guideline, and the number can be increased or decreased as desired. More SPP will enable more player advancements, fewer SPP will obviously allow for fewer player advancements.</p>
<p>If two coaches are drafting teams for exhibition play between themselves, they should take a few minutes to determine how many SPP they will have first. Tournament organisers should decide how many SPP participants will have and ensure this information is passed on to participants.</p>
<h6>Spending SPP</h6>
<p>The first thing to bear in mind when drafting a team for exhibition play is that randomly selected Skills or characteristic improvements are perhaps best avoided. This is especially true in tournament play. Randomly selecting Skills or characteristic improvements ahead of each round can slow proceedings down quite a lot.</p>
<p>This leaves coaches with the option to choose Primary or Secondary skills for some of their players. How coaches distribute SPP between players is up to them. It is just as acceptable to create one superstar player with several new Skills as it is to distribute SPP evenly between a number of players. How many advancements a single player can be given should be discussed between coaches or decided by tournament organisers. Any SPP that are not spent are lost.</p>
<p>For example, if a coach has 36 SPP to spend they may choose to distribute them evenly, giving six players a Primary skill, or giving four players a Primary skill and one player a Secondary skill. Alternatively, all of the SPP could be spent on one player.</p>
<h6>VALUE INCREASE</h6>
<p>In league play, a player's value will increase as they spend SPP and gain advancements. However, for simplicity, this is not the case when drafting a team for exhibition play. No matter how many advancements a player is given, their value does not increase.</p>
<p>In other words, coaches do not have to worry about covering the cost of any additional Skills or characteristic increases players are given with gold pieces from their Team Draft Budget. Such advancements do not increase a player's value in exhibition play.</p>
