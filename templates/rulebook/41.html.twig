<h4>3. The Kick-Off Event</h4>
<p>Every kick-off is a unique event. Almost anything can happen, and often does!</p>
<p>Immediately after the kick has deviated, whilst the ball is still high in the air, the coach of the kicking team rolls 2D6 and consults the Kick-off Event table opposite.</p>
<h5>What goes up, must come down</h5>
<p>Once the Kick-off event has been resolved, the ball will come back down to be caught by a player or to land on the ground, as described on <a href="#p25">page 25</a>.</p>
<h5>Touchbacks</h5>
<p>A kick-off must land safely in the receiving team's half of the pitch. If the ball deviates or bounces off the pitch or across the Line of Scrimmage into the kicking team's half of the pitch for any reason at all, a 'touchback' is caused. When a touchback is caused, after the Kick-off event has been resolved as normal, the coach of the receiving team gives possession of the ball to one of their players. No Agility test is required, the player is simply handed the ball. Should it ever occur that there is no Standing player on the receiving team to take possession of the ball, the ball is given to a Prone or Stunned player and will bounce.</p>
