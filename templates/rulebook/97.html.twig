<h3>Running a League</h3>
<p>In order to set up a league, the first thing needed is a league commissioner. The league commissioner is the member of any group of regularly meeting coaches who takes up the responsibility for making sure that a league runs smoothly. Some league commissioners like to keep a central database of teams to keep track of how well everyone is doing, and some even write regular newsletters featuring game reports, league tables and anything else they can think of! Most league commissioners will take part in the league with a team of their own.</p>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>To run a league, you will need at least four teams. At the start of the league, each participating coach needs to draft a team as described on <a href="#p30">page 30</a> and submit a copy of their Team Draft list to the league commissioner.</p>
<h5>Seasons</h5>
<p>A Blood Bowl league plays out over a number of 'seasons', each split into the 'regular season' and the 'play-off season'. At the end of each play-off season, comes the 'off-season break', a rest from the action before the next season begins. After the off-season break, returning and new coaches alike can draft a new team for the season ahead. Should the league commissioner wish, returning coaches can re-draft an existing team as described on <a href="#p100">page 100</a>.</p>
<h5>Divisions</h5>
<p>If the league contains enough teams, the league commissioner may wish to divide them into two, three or four divisions. Each division should contain as equal a number of teams as possible, but a division should have no fewer than four teams. The larger the divisions are, the longer a season will last. The teams can be split however the league commissioner decides, but drawing team names out of an upturned Blood Bowl helmet (or similar receptacle) is most traditional. Once the divisions have been split, the season can begin!</p>
<h4>The Regular Season</h4>
<p>During a season, each team plays two 'league fixtures' against each other team in their division. These games should be played to a schedule of 'rounds', drawn up by the league commissioner and made available to all coaches. 'Cross division friendly' games can also be played on a challenge basis against teams in other divisions that a team and their coach may not otherwise face.</p>
<h5>League Fixtures</h5>
<p>It is recommended that you set a time limit for each round. This prevents the league stalling because two players can't seem to get their schedules to line up. A good rule for deciding a time limit is to assume that each team can play one game per week. Any league fixtures that have not been played by the end of the time limit count as a loss for both teams unless one coach voluntarily concedes due to real life commitments. In this case, the other team wins 1-0, gains D6x10,000 gold pieces and may make two MVP awards.</p>
<p>After a league fixture has been played, both teams follow the full post-game sequence as described on <a href="#p69">page 69</a>. Note that both coaches are responsible for correctly recording the outcome of the game and passing that information on to the league commissioner.</p>
<p>
    <strong>NO-SHOWS:</strong> If a coach is thought to be gaming the system â€“ i.e., avoiding certain games just to prevent their opponent from getting a win or to protect their players from harm ahead of another game, the league commissioner should dock that coach 3 League points.
</p>
<h5>Cross Division Friendlies</h5>
<p>During the regular season, any two coaches that are not in the same division may arrange for their teams to play a friendly game. Each team can play as many or as few friendly games as they wish, but two teams can only play each other in this manner once. Coaches should note that during the post-game sequence of a friendly, no MVP is awarded and no League points are won. In all other respects, a friendly is treated just like a league fixture.</p>
