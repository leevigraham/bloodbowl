<h5>Knocked Down</h5>
<p>Several block dice results cause one (or both!) players to be Knocked Down, as described on <a href="#p27">page 27</a>. This can lead to a Turnover, as described on <a href="#p23">page 23</a>, if a player is Knocked Down when they are the one performing the Block action! If a player is pushed back and Knocked Down, the push back happens first and the player is Knocked Down in the square they have been moved into.</p>
<h5>Placed Prone</h5>
<p>Some Skills may allow a player that is Knocked Down during a Block action to instead be Placed Prone. Where this is the case, the rules above are unchanged, it is simply the outcome that is altered as no Armour roll is made against a player that is Placed Prone and they do not risk injury.</p>
<h4>Follow-Up</h4>
<p>When an active player making a Block action pushes the target back they may 'follow-up', moving directly into the square vacated by the pushed back player. You must decide if your player will follow-up before any further dice rolls are made. When a player follows-up, it is a free move; they do not need to Rush, they do not need to Dodge, and they do not count as having used any of their Movement Allowance.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a player must follow-up due to an in-game effect, a special rule, or a Skill or Trait, whether they want to or not. At other times, a player may be prevented from following-up even if they want to, perhaps due to a Skill the target of the Block action possesses for example. In such cases, rules that prevent a player from following-up always take precedence.</p>
<p>Note that when a player follows-up, they are always considered to have moved voluntarily. This is the case even when a player must follow-up due to an in-game effect, a special rule, or a Skill or Trait, whether they want to or not.</p>
<h4>Blitz Actions</h4>
<p>Usually, when a player performs a Block action, it is performed on its own. But, once per team turn as mentioned on <a href="#p43">page 43</a>, a single Standing or Prone player on the active team may be activated to perform a Blitz action; an action that allows the player to combine a Move action and a Block action. When a player Blitzes, they may move as normal. In addition, they may perform a Block action (or a Special action granted by a Skill or Trait that can be performed instead of a Block action), the target of which must be nominated when the player is activated, before they have moved.</p>
<p>Movement during a Blitz action follows all of the normal rules for moving as described on <a href="#p44">page 44</a>. The Block action (or a Special action) can be made before, after or even during the Blitz move, meaning that the player can move part of their Movement Allowance, perform a Block action (or a Special action), and then continue to move should they wish and if they are able to do so.</p>
<p>Performing the Block action (or a Special action granted by a Skill or Trait that can be performed instead of a Block action) costs one square of the player's Movement Allowance. However, depending upon the outcome of the Block action, the player may follow up as described above, effectively regaining this lost square of Movement Allowance.</p>
<p>During their movement, a player performing a Blitz action may attempt to gain extra squares of Movement Allowance by Rushing, as described on <a href="#p44">page 44</a>. If after moving the player does not have sufficient Movement Allowance remaining to perform the Block action (or a Special action granted by a Skill or Trait that can be performed instead of a Block action), they may Rush to gain the square of Movement Allowance required. If they cannot Rush, they cannot perform the Block action (or a Special action).</p>
