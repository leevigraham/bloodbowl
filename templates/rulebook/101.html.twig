<h3>Exhibition Play</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, not everyone is able to commit the time required to take part in a league. Coaches may not live close to their gaming friends, work and family commitments might contrive to keep us away from our hobby, meaning that often we are only able to enjoy the occasional stand-alone game when time permits. Such stand-alone games are referred to as 'exhibition games'. What's more, there is no reason to miss out on the fun of many aspects of the game that appear to be designed for league play; it is possible to create teams for exhibition games complete with extra Skills, characteristic improvements and access to weird and wonderful Inducements, including Star Players. There is a lot of fun to be had in creating a team for an exhibition game, deciding what will be included and what will be left out, choosing Skills, creating names and backstories for the players, and so on.</p>
<h4>Blood Bowl Exhibition Play Rules</h4>
<p>The following pages offer a set of guidelines for creating exhibition play teams. Coaches who wish to use these rules for a game should decide between themselves on the details. Further, this section aims to give guidance to anyone wanting to run a Blood Bowl tournament, as these rules will help create more interesting teams for participants to use, which in turn will enhance the experience for everyone involved. Drafting an Exhibition Team</p>
<p>This section deals with how to create a team for an exhibition game. For the most part this is exactly the same as creating a team for a league, right down to using the usual team rosters and completing a Team Draft list. However, there are some distinct differences to be aware of:</p>
<h5>Team Draft Budget</h5>
<p>For exhibition games, coaches should have more gold in their Team Draft Budget, allowing them to include more of the options that normally only become available later on in a league.</p>
<p>The Team Draft Budget for exhibition play should be somewhere between 1,100,000 and 1,300,000 gold pieces. We have found that 1,150,000 gold pieces is an ideal size. Larger is possible should coaches or tournament organisers wish, but it is worth bearing in mind that smaller Team Draft Budgets force hard choices to be made. Sometimes, having to choose whether to include one thing or the other is better than having both as it adds to the challenge of the experience.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that when a team is drafted for exhibition play, all of the gold pieces in the Team Draft Budget must be spent. Any gold pieces not spent are lost. One consequence of this is that the Prayers to Nuffle table is only used for Cheering Fans in exhibition play, as described on <a href="#p41">page 41</a>.</p>
<p>A Team Draft list will need to be completed for the team, detailing all of the players, Sideline Staff and any Inducements purchased. This is especially important when attending a Blood Bowl tournament, so that your opponents can see clearly what your team contains!</p>
<h6>Hiring Players</h6>
<p>As with league play, players are the only compulsory element on a team drafted for exhibition play. Each team roster details all of the players available to a team of that type and their Hiring Fee. When drafting a team, you should select the players you want to permanently hire for your team, pay their hiring cost from the Team Draft Budget and make a record of the player on the Team Draft list.</p>
<p>As usual, a team may not include more players of a certain type than are allowed by the team roster.</p>
<h6>Purchasing Team Re-rolls</h6>
<p>Any team drafted for exhibition play can purchase team re-rolls, just like a team drafted for league play. Every team may buy 0-8 team re-rolls when it is drafted, for the cost shown on the team roster, paid for from the Team Draft Budget.</p>
<h6>Hiring Sideline Staff</h6>
<p>Sideline Staff can be of as much use to a team drafted for exhibition play as they are during a league. A team drafted for exhibition play can purchase Sideline Staff from the Team Draft Budget.</p>
<h6>Dedicated Fans</h6>
<p>Unlike a team drafted for league play, a team drafted for exhibition play will have a Dedicated Fans characteristic of 0.</p>
<p>However, teams drafted for exhibition play can still improve this up to a maximum of 6, at a cost of 10,000 gold pieces per improvement, as described on <a href="#p35">page 35</a>. For example, an exhibition team may purchase a Dedicated Fans characteristic of 3 at a cost of 30,000 gold pieces.</p>
