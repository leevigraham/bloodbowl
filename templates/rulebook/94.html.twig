    <strong>0-1 Wizard</strong> – price varies
</h5>
<p>Wizards of the various Arcane Colleges find ready employment with the many Cabalvision networks, as it takes huge amounts of magical energy to capture the action and beam it globally to the crystal balls and magic mirrors of Cabalvision subscribers around the world. Consequently, there are always Wizards to be found at any given fixture, card carrying members of the Colleges of Magic, all more than happy to moonlight for a team wishing to secure their assistance.</p>
<p>No team may purchase more than one Wizard Inducement per game.</p>
<p>Some Wizards are named, although most are not. As with Star Players, it is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same named Wizard:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can use the named Wizard but the named Wizard will keep both hiring fees.</li>
    <li>If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can use the named Wizard– one team has clearly hired a ringer!</li>
</ul>
<p>If a Wizard Inducement is not named, there is no restriction on both teams fielding the same type. There are too many types of</p>
<p>Wizard to list here, and most are only available to certain teams. Details of further Wizards can be found in the various Blood Bowl supplements available.</p>

    <strong>0-1 Wizard Inducement: Hireling Sports-Wizard</strong> – 150,000 Gold Pieces, available to any team
</h5>
<p>The spells a Hireling Sports Wizard will use are carefully selected to amaze and amuse the fans in equal measure. Many spectacular fireballs explode on pitches just as often as opposition players are turned into frogs. A player turned into a frog can be turned back quite quickly with no more lasting consequences than an inexplicable desire to sit on a log and eat flies (if they're lucky enough to be changed back at all, that is!).</p>
<p>Once per game, a Hireling Sports-Wizard may cast one of the following spells:</p>
<h6>Fireball</h6>
<del class="block errata">
    <p>You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Choose a target square anywhere on the pitch and roll a D6 for each Standing player (from either team) that occupies either the target square or a square adjacent to it:</p>
</del>
<ins class="block errata">
    <p>You may cast this spell at the end of either player’s team turn, before the next team turn begins.</p>
</ins>
<ul>
    <li>On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the Fireball.</li>
    <li>On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the Fireball.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any Standing players hit by the Fireball are Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Fireball, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.</p>
<h6>Zap!</h6>
<p>You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Target any opposition player and roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the roll is equal to or higher than the player's Strength characteristic, or is a natural 6, that player turns into a frog for the remainder of the drive, after which their coach will secure emergency magical assistance to turn the player back into their original form.</li>
    <li>If the roll is lower than the player's Strength characteristic, the player develops a fresh crop of warts, but the spell has no further effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the player was in possession of the ball when they were turned into a frog, it is dropped and will bounce. When a roll on the Casualty table is required against the frog, no roll is made. Instead, it is automatically treated as if a Badly Hurt result had been rolled. The frog must miss the rest of the game and cannot be patched-up by an apothecary (because it's a frog!). At the end of the game, the player is returned to normal shape with no ill effects.</p>
<p>The frog has the following profile:</p>
