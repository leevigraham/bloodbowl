    <p>"Good evening! I'm Bob Bifford, welcoming you once again to an evening of thrilling sports action! You join a capacity crowd, eagerly anticipating this clash of champions. Before kick-off we've just got time to recap recent events for the benefit of anyone who has been living under a stone (and a hearty good evening to Snotlings everywhere!), and to do that I'm joined as ever by Jim Johnson. Evening, Jim!"</p>
    <p>"Thank you, Bob! Well, good evening, and boy, are you folks in for a great night of top-class sporting entertainment! And first, let me just say that it's been quite the season so far, isn't that so, Bob?"</p>
    <p>"How right you are, Jim!"</p>
    <p>"It's been a tumultuous decade for fans of Blood Bowl. Since the collapse of the NAF, numerous exciting new leagues have sprung up and the face of the game has changed considerably. It seems that every week a new team has joined the circuit, bringing with it some new gimmick to surprise and delight the fans! And this season has been no exception. We're witness today to a clash between two new teams: the Bogenhafen Barons and the Thunder Valley Greenskins. Squads that no one had even heard of just a few short months ago, but who now stand poised on the brink of greatness!"</p>
    <p>"That's right, Jim. Joined as they are by two sporting megastars, Griff Oberwald and Varag Ghoul-Chewer, we can be assured that, new though these teams are, we're in for a classic grudge match!"</p>
    <p>"Indeed, Bob. This game is sure to be one to remember!"</p>

                <h2>The History Blood Bowl</h2>
<p>Blood Bowl has always been a part of our world. The sacred tablets of Lustria,
    old beyond all human reckoning, tell of a time when the world was young,
    when the mythical Old Ones and their servants, the Slann, introduced the
    worship of Nuffle – the god of violent sports – to the world.
    Millennia later, the hieroglyphs of ancient Nehekhara tell of a time when mighty
    heroes of the sport played and died, and were laid to rest in the grandest
    mausoleums their sponsors could contrive, there to live out eternity beside kings in a
    time before being raised from undeath to play once more.
    Ages later still, Blood Bowl would be re-discovered by mortals and go on to take
    over the world, ushering in an eternal age where wars would be fought not on muddy
    battlefields but on bloody astrogranite, to the entertainment of baying
    crowds the whole world over!</p>

                <h2>Blood Bowl Stadia</h2>
<p>Blood Bowl pitches can be found the world over, from the sweltering rainforests of Lustria, where archaic stadia occupy ancient temple cities, to the ice floes of Norsca, where rugged gridirons are carved from the glaciers and permafrost, and everything in between and beyond. They range from small and humble affairs, temporarily marked-out pitches surrounded by simple bleachers set up for a low budget tournament, to truly grand stadia such as the Emperor Luitpold I Memorial stadium in the heart of Altdorf, home of the Blood Bowl itself, the grandest tournament held in the finest arena in all the known world.</p>
<p>This section explains the layout of a Blood Bowl pitch, the sideline area, and details the accessories needed to play the game.</p>

                <a href="#p19" class="page-number">#19</a>
                <h3>Nuffle's Sacred Turf</h3>
<p>Wherever they are and however they are built, all Blood Bowl pitches are laid out following the same, sacred parameters as decreed in the holy book of Nuffle. Before every game, anywhere in the known world, members of the Referees and Allied Ruleskeepers Guild (RARG),will walk the length and breadth of the pitch, ensuring the measurements are exact: 60 paces wide by 100 paces long.</p>
<h4>The Blood Bowl Pitch</h4>
<p><img src="./images/pitch.png" width="474" height="312"></p>
<p>A Blood Bowl pitch is split into several distinct sections and all share the same features:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Two End Zones, one at each short end of the pitch.</li>
    <li>Two Wide Zones, one at each side of the pitch, running from End Zone to End Zone.</li>
    <li>Two Sidelines, running the length of the pitch, from End Zone to End Zone.</li>
    <li>The Centre Field, the area between each Wide Zone, running the length of the pitch from End Zone to End Zone.</li>
    <li>There are two trapdoors on the pitch, one in each half, both positioned within a Wide Zone.</li>
    <li>The pitch is then further split along its length into two halves by the Line of Scrimmage, the point at which both teams line up for the kick-off and at which much of the most violent action unfolds!</li>
</ol>
<p> Finally, the board itself is split into a grid of squares; 13 squares from Line of Scrimmage to End Zone, making the pitch 26 squares long in total, and 15 squares wide; four squares in each Wide Zone and seven squares across the Centre Field.</p>
<h4>Dugouts</h4>
<p><img src="./images/dugout.png" width="355" height="211"></p>
<p>Each team has its own dugout, a safe haven at pitch side where reserves can warm up, where the injured can be tended to and where important game information is tracked:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Reserves box, where fit and healthy players stand ready for the next drive.</li>
    <li>The Knocked-out box, where players removed from play due to minor injury recover.</li>
    <li>The Casualty box, where seriously hurt players are tended and where those who won't play again are stored until the final whistle.</li>
    <li>Turn trackers. These are vital, helping everyone know which turn it is and how long remains of the current half and the game. The Turn trackers are covered in greater detail on pages 20 and 42.</li>
    <li>Team re-roll trackers, used to keep track of how many re-rolls a team still has to call upon in each half. Re-rolls are covered in more detail on <a href="#p24">page 24</a>.</li>
    <li>The Score tracker, where the coach keeps a record of each touchdown scored.</li>
</ol>

                <h3>Sporting Paraphernalia</h3>
<p>Blood Bowl teams rarely travel light. Be it the kit and armour of the players, the pom-poms and ribbons of the cheerleading squads or the bandages, saws and splints of the apothecaries, there is no end of equipment to be hauled from stadium to stadium. On the tabletop, games of Blood Bowl require somewhat less in the way of equipment, but there are certain accessories that are vital to the game.</p>
<h4>The Football</h4>
<p>Arguably, the most important model on the pitch! When not in the possession of a player (i.e., when being held and carried by a player), the football or, more simply, the ball, is placed on the ground, wholly within one otherwise empty square. When in a player's possession it will occupy a place on or adjacent to the base of that model.</p>
<p>The ball is an essential component in any game of Blood Bowl, and there are a great many ways in which it can be represented, from a simple token to a painted and based model the rival of any player.</p>
<h4>Markers</h4>
<p>The game of Blood Bowl uses several markers in conjunction with the dugouts in order to keep track of important game information:</p>
<h5>Turn Marker</h5>
<p>You will need a turn marker, and it is your responsibility, at the beginning of each and every one of your turns, to move the turn marker along the Turn tracker on your dugout.</p>
<h5>Team Re-roll Marker(s)</h5>
<p>Similarly, you are responsible for keeping track of how many team re-rolls you have and how many have been used. You may use either a single marker or several markers (one for each team re-roll) as you prefer.</p>
<h5>Score Marker</h5>
<p>A score marker is used to keep track of how many touchdowns a team has scored, by placing the marker on the zero position on the Score tracker and moving it along after a touchdown is scored.</p>
<h4>Templates</h4>
<p>Blood Bowl also makes use of three unique templates. These are the 'Random Direction template', the 'Throw-in template' and the 'range ruler'. These are used as described below.</p>
<h5>The Random Direction Template</h5>
<p>This template is used whenever the ball 'scatters', 'bounces' or 'deviates' (see <a href="#p25">page 25</a>), or when the rules call for a random direction to be determined for any other reason. Position the template as shown in the diagram below, with the centre of the template over the square the ball is within and roll a D8 to determine the direction.</p>
<p>
    <img src="./images/random-direction-template.jpg" width="311" height="312">
</p>
<h5>The Throw-in Template</h5>
<p> If the ball ever leaves the pitch, the crowd will enthusiastically throw it back. Position the Throw-in template as shown in the diagram below, with the Blood Bowl logo over the last square the ball occupied before leaving the pitch and roll a D6 to determine the direction the ball travels in.</p>
<p>Throw-ins are covered in greater detail on <a href="#p51">page 51</a>.</p>

                <a href="#p21" class="page-number">#21</a>
                <h5>Corner Throw-ins</h5>
<p>Should the ball leave the pitch from a corner square, the direction of the throw-in is determined by placing the Random Direction template as shown in the diagram and rolling a D3.</p>
<p>
    <img src="./images/corner-throw-ins.jpg" width="292" height="198">
</p>
<h5>The Range Ruler</h5>
<p>This is used when a Pass or Throw Team-Mate action is performed, both to determine range and, in the case of a Pass action, to determine if any opposition players can attempt to interfere with the pass.</p>
<p>
    <img src="./images/range-ruler.jpg" width="312" height="452">
</p>
<p>Pass actions are covered in greater detail on <a href="#p48">page 48</a> and Throw Team-Mate actions on <a href="#p52">page 52</a>.</p>
<h4>Blood Bowl Dice</h4>
<p>The game of Blood Bowl uses four different types of dice to determine the outcome of various actions and events. These are often referred to as 'Nuffle's sacred cubes' in homage to the patron god of Blood Bowl. Interestingly (perhaps), not all of these dice are cubes!</p>
<h5>Block Dice</h5>
<p>Unique to the game of Blood Bowl, block dice are used to resolve Block and Blitz actions against opposition players. They are six-sided dice that feature five unique icons (one is duplicated on two faces), each representing a different outcome (see <a href="#p57">page 57</a>).</p>
<h5>D6</h5>
<p>Blood Bowl also uses regular six-sided dice, marked 1 to 6. It is common for the '6' to be replaced by a logo – either that of the game or a specific team – on many Blood Bowl dice.</p>
<ul>
    <li> D3: The rules might also call for a D3 to be rolled, but an actual three-sided dice is not necessary. To roll a D3, simply roll a D6 and halve the result, rounding fractions up.</li>
</ul>
<h5>D8</h5>
<p>An eight-sided dice is often, though not exclusively, used in conjunction with the Random Direction template.</p>
<h5>D16</h5>
<p>A 16-sided dice. Less frequently used but no less vital, a D16 is used for some of the tables in the rules that follow or to select players at random from within a team.</p>

                <h2>Rules and Regulations</h2>
<p>Blood Bowl is a complex game of ancient traditions, governed by rules and regulations older than imagining. That's the official line. In truth, the game of Blood Bowl as it is known today was hurriedly translated from an ancient and illegible tome by an elderly, near-sighted Dwarf. After completing this first, rushed draft, the sacred commissioner Roze-El spent many years trying to translate the Tome of Nuffle properly. Where this proved impossible, he relied on that most time-honoured tradition amongst scribes and historians and simply filled in the details by making stuff up!</p>
<p>Since the time of Roze-El, numerous others have had their say in the development of the rules. Consequently, the game as it is known today is unlikely to bear more than a passing resemblance to the original form of Nuffle's sacred game. Nuffle himself doesn't seem to be overly concerned by this, which is probably just as well!</p>
<p>This section covers in detail the rules and regulations of the game of Blood Bowl.</p>

                <h3>General Principles</h3>
<p>Before going further, it is worth establishing some general principles regarding some commonly used terms, dice and the game of Blood Bowl in general.</p>
<h4>The Coach and the Players</h4>
<p>Blood Bowl is a tabletop game and tabletop games are traditionally played by 'players'. But Blood Bowl is also a game that represents a sporting fixture rather than a battle between rival armies. Whilst in other tabletop games the models might represent warriors, in Blood Bowl the models represent sports players. To avoid confusion, and to adhere to the theme of the game, the rules will always refer to the models as 'players' and to you, the person rolling the dice and making the decisions, as the 'coach'. In addition, players that belong to the same team are referred to as 'team-mates', whilst players that do not belong to their team are referred to as 'opposition players'.</p>
<h5>Take-backs and Changing Ones Mind</h5>
<p>It is not uncommon for coaches to second guess themselves occasionally, saying they are about to do something before immediately changing their mind. As a general rule, you should be tolerant of this in your opponents as you will likely do it yourself! However, once dice have been rolled for any reason, you must abide by your decision; you can no longer go back and change anything that came before the dice roll!</p>
<h5>Randomly Selecting a Player</h5>
<p>The rules will often require a coach to select a player at random. To do this, simply roll a D16 and check the Team Draft list. The number rolled is the player selected. If the number rolled doesn't correspond to a player or, as is often the case, if the number rolled doesn't meet the criteria of the player to be randomly selected (perhaps the number rolled corresponds to a player not on the pitch, for example) simply re-roll the dice.</p>
<h4>The Turnover</h4>
<p>One of the most important mechanics of the game of Blood Bowl is the 'Turnover'. Many unfortunate events will cause the active team's turn to end prematurely with a Turnover, regardless of how many players have been activated.</p>
<p>A Turnover is caused:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a player on the active team Falls Over during their own activation.</li>
    <li>If a player on the active team is Knocked Down during their team turn.</li>
    <li>If a player on the active team that is in possession of the ball is Placed Prone during their team turn.</li>
    <li>If a player on the active team that is in possession of the ball is forced to move off the pitch for any reason.</li>
    <li>If a player on the active team attempts to pick up the ball from the ground and fails, even if the bouncing ball is then caught by a player from the active team.</li>
    <li>If a player on the active team fumbles a Pass action, even if the bouncing ball is then caught by a player from the active team.</li>
    <li>If no player on the active team catches the ball after a Pass action or a Hand-off action and the ball comes to rest on the ground or in the possession of a player from the opposing team.</li>
    <li>If a Pass action is Deflected or Intercepted and the ball comes to rest either on the ground or in the possession of a player from the opposing team.</li>
    <li>If a player on the active team that is in possession of the ball is thrown by a team-mate and either fails to land safely, lands in the crowd or is eaten, even if the bouncing ball is then caught by a player from the active team.</li>
    <li>If a player on the active team is Sent-off by the referee for committing a Foul.</li>
    <li>If a touchdown is scored.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is not exhaustive; there may be other events that will cause a Turnover. Where this is the case, these will be detailed by the rules.</p>
<p>Should a Turnover occur, any dice rolls that must be made as a result of the event that caused it are made immediately, after which the current player activation ends. The active team may not activate any more players and the current team turn ends.</p>
<p>For example, should one of your players Fall Over whilst moving, an Armour roll is made against them. If that player was in possession of the ball, the ball will then bounce. Once the ball has come to rest, the player's activation ends and you may activate no more players this turn. Finally, your team turn ends and the opposing team becomes the active team.</p>

                <h4>Dice Rolling</h4>
<p>The game of Blood Bowl uses dice rolls a great deal. The roll of a dice determines everything, be it a simple attempt to pick up the ball, or the effectiveness of a sneaky foul.</p>
<h5>Multiple Dice Rolls</h5>
<p>Often the rules will state 'roll 2D6'. In such cases, two D6 are rolled and the results added together to give a total between 2 and 12. This is a multiple dice roll.</p>
<h5>Dice Pools</h5>
<p>Sometimes the game may require two or more dice be rolled and a single result selected – for example, a coach might roll two or three block dice and select one result to apply. In this case a 'pool' of dice has been rolled.</p>
<h5>Target Number Rolls</h5>
<p>Usually, when making a single dice roll or a multiple dice roll, the rules will require you to roll a specific number followed by a '+'. This indicates that the roll is a 'target number roll'. Making a target number roll is simple. If you are required to roll a 4+ on a single D6, for example, a roll of 4, 5 or 6 would be a success, but a roll of 1, 2 or 3 would not be.</p>
<h5>Modifying Dice Rolls</h5>
<p>The rules will often call for a dice roll to be modified, particularly when making a target number roll. To do this, simply roll the dice and then add or subtract the modifier(s) shown, effectively changing the outcome of the dice roll. If the rules ever instruct you to divide a dice roll in any way, any fractions should be rounded up, unless the rules state otherwise.</p>
<h5>Rolling Off</h5>
<p>The rules may call for both coaches to roll a dice (usually either a D6 or a D3). Often a characteristic of some sort will be added to the result. This is called 'rolling off' and the highest score always wins a roll-off. In the case of a tie, roll again unless otherwise instructed.</p>
<h5>Natural Rolls</h5>
<p>A 'natural' roll is the actual number rolled on a dice, regardless of modifiers. It is not uncommon for a test to be passed if a natural 6 is rolled or failed if a natural 1 is rolled, even if modifiers might seemingly make success a certainty or failure seem impossible.</p>
<h4>Re-rolls</h4>
<p>When rolling dice, it is common for things to go wrong! Fortunately, Blood Bowl allows for certain dice rolls to be re-rolled:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The second result must always be accepted, even if it is worse than the original result.</li>
    <li>A dice can never be re-rolled more than once, regardless of the source of the re-roll.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Skill Re-Rolls</h5>
<p>Many players possess Skills that allow them to re-roll dice in a specific situation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Skill re-rolls can only be used as detailed in the Skill's description.</li>
    <li>Skill re-rolls can be used during either team's turn, as appropriate.</li>
    <li>When a dice pool is rolled, a Skill re-roll will allow only certain results to be re-rolled, as detailed in the Skill's description.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Team Re-Rolls</h5>
<p>Every Blood Bowl team will have a number of team re-rolls to use during a game. A team will start each game with its full complement of team re-rolls. Any used during the first half of a game are replenished in full at the start of the second half, but unused team re-rolls do not carry over from the first half to the second half (or from one fixture to the next in league play):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Team re-rolls can only be used when a team is active, during its own team turn.</li>
    <li>Team re-rolls cannot be used to re-roll:
        <ul>
            <li>Deviation, scatter and bounce rolls.</li>
            <li>Armour, Injury and Casualty rolls.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When a dice pool is rolled, a team re-roll can be used. When a team re-roll is used, all of the dice in the dice pool must be re-rolled (not just those dice that show an undesirable result).</li>
</ul>

</div>
                <div class="designers-commentary-qa-answer"><p>A team re-roll can only be used when a team is active and during its own team turn. It can be used to re-roll all the dice in a dice pool that were rolled during their team turn, including any dice pools rolled for any Skills or Traits used during that team turn. A team re-roll may not be used to re- roll the following rolls: Deviation, Scatter, Bounce, Armour, Injury, Casualty, Throw-in, Bribes, and Argue the Call.</p>

</div>
                <div class="designers-commentary-qa-answer"><p>Yes. Though be careful, as if you use them all early on in a half you will be facing quite a few turns without any! Remember that you can never re-roll a re-roll.</p>

</div>
                <div class="designers-commentary-qa-answer"><p>No. What this means is that a team will always start each half with their full complement of team re-rolls, and those that are not spent in the first half cannot then be saved to add on to your store of team re-rolls. A team that starts the first half with 3 team re-rolls, will also start the second half with 3 re-rolls.</p>

                <h4>Deviate, Scatter or Bounce</h4>
<h5>Deviate</h5>
<p>This represents a kicked ball or desperate pass veering wildly off target:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When the ball deviates, it moves a number of squares equal to the roll of a D6 from the square in which it was placed, in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the random direction template.</li>
    <li>If the ball lands in a square that is occupied by a Standing player that has not lost their Tackle Zone (see <a href="#p26">page 26</a>), that player must attempt to catch the ball (see <a href="#p51">page 51</a>). If they fail, it will bounce as described opposite.</li>
    <li>If the ball lands in an unoccupied square or a square that is occupied either by a Standing player that has lost their Tackle Zone or by a Prone or Stunned player, it will bounce before it comes to rest on the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Scatter</h5>
<p>This happens whenever a ball (or a thrown player) in the air travels in an unexpected way:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When the ball scatters, it moves from the square in which it was placed three times before landing, each time moving one square in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template.</li>
    <li>A player cannot attempt to catch the ball should it enter the square they occupy on the first or second scatter roll, as it is still high in the air at this point.</li>
    <li>If after the third scatter roll the ball lands in a square that is occupied by a Standing player that has not lost their Tackle Zone, that player must attempt to catch the ball. If they fail, it will bounce.</li>
    <li>If after the third scatter roll the ball lands in an unoccupied square or a square that is occupied by either a Standing player that has lost their Tackle Zone or by a Prone or Stunned player, it will bounce before it comes to rest on the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Bounce</h5>
<p>This happens for many reasons, most often when the ball (or the player in possession of it!) hits the ground or when a player drops it:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When the ball bounces, it moves one square in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template.</li>
    <li>If the ball bounces into a square that is occupied by a Standing player that has not lost their Tackle Zone, that player must attempt to catch the ball. If they fail, it will bounce again.</li>
    <li>If the ball bounces into a square that is occupied either by a Standing player that has lost their Tackle Zone or by a Prone or Stunned player, the ball will continue to bounce until it is caught by a Standing player or it comes to rest in an unoccupied square.</li>
</ul>
                                
            </div>
                    <div id="p26" class="page">
                <a href="#p26" class="page-number">#26</a>
                <h3>Player Status</h3>
<p>In games of Blood Bowl, the status of a player is very important. A player that is standing can achieve far more than one that is not! A player that has been pushed to the ground can recover quite quickly compared to one that has to regain their senses before playing on.</p>
<p>Most of the time, a player will be 'Standing'. At other times a player will be either 'Prone' or 'Stunned'.</p>
<h4>Standing Players</h4>
<p>Players that are Standing when activated have the greatest freedom to move. Players that are Standing during the opposing team's turn are able to hinder their plays.</p>
<h5>The Tackle Zone</h5>
<p>A Standing player exerts control over the squares around them. This is called their 'Tackle Zone' and covers all of the eight squares adjacent to a Standing player, as shown in the diagram.</p>
<p>
    <img src="./images/tackle-zones.jpg" width="317" height="490">
</p>
<h5>Open Players</h5>
<p>A player that is not being Marked, i.e., a player that is not within the Tackle Zone of any opposition players (as described below), is said to be 'Open'. Open players can move freely and perform actions more easily, free from the interference of opposition players.</p>
<p>
    <img src="./images/open-players.jpg" width="315" height="184">
</p>
<h5>Marking and Being Marked</h5>
<p>Players use their Tackle Zone to interfere with opposition players, 'Marking' them and hindering their actions:</p>
<ul> If a player occupies a square that is within an opposition player's Tackle Zone, they are being 'Marked' by that opposition player.
    <li>If a player has an opposition player within their Tackle Zone, they are 'Marking' that opposition player.</li>
    <li>A Standing player Marks all opposition players that are within their Tackle Zone.</li>
    <li>A player can be Marked by multiple opposition players at the same time.</li>
    <li>A player that has lost their Tackle Zone for any reason cannot Mark an opposition player, though they can be Marked themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players never Mark team-mates – they will only Mark opposition players. Marking opposition players, and being Marked by them in turn, has multiple in-game effects.</p>
<h5>Losing Tackle Zones</h5>
<p>Prone and Stunned players lose their Tackle Zone. It may also happen that, due to an in-game effect, a special rule or a Skill used by an opposition player, a Standing player loses their Tackle Zone.</p>
<p>If a player has lost their Tackle Zone they:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cannot Mark other players.</li>
    <li>Cannot attempt to interfere with a Pass action.</li>
    <li>Cannot attempt to catch the ball.</li>
</ul>
<p>They will also be unable to use certain other Skills that require a player to have a Tackle Zone.</p>

                                
            </div>
                    <div id="p27" class="page">
                <a href="#p27" class="page-number">#27</a>
                <h4>Prone and Stunned Players</h4>
<p>Players that are not Standing will be either 'Prone' or 'Stunned'. All such players occupy one square on the pitch – the square they were in when they became Prone or Stunned – no matter how big the player.</p>
<h5>Prone</h5>
<p>When a player is Prone, the model is laid face-up on the pitch. A Prone player can do nothing until they have stood up. A Prone player may be activated during their team turn to perform any action that includes Movement Allowance. Doing so allows the player to sacrifice a portion of their movement to stand up (see <a href="#p44">page 44</a>).</p>
<h5>Stunned</h5>
<p>When a player is Stunned, the model is laid face-down on the pitch. A Stunned player is not eligible to be activated during their team turn. When a team's turn ends, even if it ends with a Turnover, any players that were Stunned when the turn began will automatically roll over and become Prone. If a player became Stunned during the course of their own team turn, they must remain Stunned until the end of their team's next turn, when they will automatically roll over and become Prone.</p>
<h5>Becoming Prone or Stunned</h5>
<p>Usually, a player becomes Prone as the result of 'Falling Over' or being 'Knocked Down'. When a player Falls Over or is Knocked Down, they also 'risk injury', meaning they may become Stunned or worse. Alternatively, a player may be 'Placed Prone' without risk of injury.</p>
<h6>Placed Prone</h6>
<p>Being Placed Prone is often a deliberate choice a player is able to make due to a Skill they possess. At other times an in-game effect, a special rule or a Skill used by an opposition player may cause one of your players to be Placed Prone by your opponent:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a player is Placed Prone during their activation, their activation ends immediately.</li>
    <li>If a player in possession of the ball is Placed Prone during their team turn, a Turnover is caused.</li>
    <li>If a player that is in possession of the ball is Placed Prone, the ball will bounce from the square in which the player was Placed Prone.</li>
    <li>When a player is Placed Prone, there is no risk of injury and no Armour roll is made against them.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Falling Over</h6>
<p>Players may 'Fall Over' when they attempt to Dodge, or they may simply Fall Over their own feet as they sprint across the pitch too quickly. When a player Falls Over it is self-inflicted, and it can only happen during a player's own activation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a player Falls Over, a Turnover is caused.</li>
    <li>If a player Falls Over, they become Prone and risk injury. The coach of the opposing team makes an Armour roll against them as described on <a href="#p29">page 29</a>:
        <ul>
            <li>If the player's armour is broken as described on <a href="#p60">page 60</a>, an Injury roll is made against them and they will become Stunned or worse.</li>
            <li>If the player's armour is not broken, they remain Prone.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If a player Falls Over whilst in possession of the ball, the ball will bounce from the square in which the player Falls Over, after making an Armour roll (and possible Injury roll) against them.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Being Knocked Down</h6>
<p>Players are often 'Knocked Down' as the result of a vicious Block action from an opposition player or when they attempt to perform a Block action against an opposition player who proves to be bigger, tougher or luckier than they are. Players can also be Knocked Down by projectiles thrown by the crowd (including spells), or by some other in-game effect, by a special rule or by a Skill used by an opposition player:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a player is Knocked Down during their team turn, a Turnover is caused.</li>
    <li>When a player is Knocked Down, they become Prone and risk injury. The coach of the opposing team makes an Armour roll against them:
        <ul>
            <li> If the player's armour is broken, an Injury roll is made against them and they will become Stunned or worse.</li>
            <li> If the player's armour is not broken, they remain Prone.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If a player is Knocked Down whilst in possession of the ball, the ball will bounce from the square in which the player was Knocked Down, after making an Armour roll (and possible Injury roll) against them.</li>

                <h3>Player Profile and Characteristic Tests</h3>
<p>Blood Bowl players are a hardy breed. Powerfully built, athletic and agile individuals of all known races, they take to the pitch seeking glory, wealth and lasting fame for themselves and their team. They play on in spite of all but the most serious of injury – indeed, it must be noted that often even death isn't a career ending event, more an… inconvenience!</p>
<h3>Player Profile</h3>
<p>The strengths and weaknesses of the players that make up a team are represented by a series of characteristics, collectively known as the player's 'profile':</p>
<ul>
    <li>Movement Allowance (MA) and Strength (ST) are both shown as simple values, in which case a higher number is better.</li>
    <li>Agility (AG), Passing Ability (PA) and Armour Value (AV) are all shown as target numbers; a number followed by a '+' symbol, as described on <a href="#p24">page 24</a>. In the case of AG and PA a lower number is better, whereas in the case of AV a higher number is better.</li>
</ul>
<p> No characteristic may ever be improved more than twice or be improved beyond the maximum shown on the table below. No characteristic may ever be reduced below the minimum shown on the table below:</p>

<h3>Characteristic Modifiers</h3>
<p>When making a test against any of a player's characteristics, there are a number of modifiers that may apply, some making success harder, some making it easier. Where modifiers apply to a Characteristic test, the rules will list and detail them:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the characteristic is given a simple value, the modifier is applied as written – for example, if a player with a Strength characteristic of 3 is given a +1 Strength modifier, their Strength characteristic becomes 4.</li>
    <li>Where a characteristic is presented as a target number, the modifier is always applied to the dice roll, as described on <a href="#p24">page 24</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the rules ever instruct you to divide a dice roll in any way, any modifiers that also apply to the roll should be applied after the roll has been divided.</p>

                <h3>Characteristics Tests</h3>
<h4>Movement Allowance (MA)</h4>
<p>This characteristic shows the number of squares the player may move when activated during their team turn. There are several actions a player can perform that allow them to move, ranging from a simple Move action to a dramatic Blitz (actions are dealt with in detail on <a href="#p43">page 43</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Strength (ST)</h4>
<p>A player's Strength characteristic represents how physically strong they are. Strength is used during Block actions, both when performing them and when defending against them.</p>
<h4>Agility (AG)</h4>
<p>A player's Agility characteristic represents their Skill and dexterity in different situations, be it how easily they can pick up the ball or their ability to break away from a scrum.</p>
<h5>Agility Tests</h5>
<p>You will often be required to test against a player's Agility. An Agility test is a target number roll made on a single D6, as described on <a href="#p24">page 24</a>. In addition, if the roll is a natural 6, the test is automatically passed. However, if the roll is a natural 1, the test is automatically failed.</p>
<h4>Passing Ability (PA)</h4>
<p>This characteristic represents the player's ability to pass the ball (and in some cases other players and perhaps even bombs!).</p>
<h5>Passing Ability Tests</h5>
<p>You will often be required to test against a player's Passing Ability. A Passing Ability test is a target number roll made on a single D6. In addition, if the roll is a natural 6, the test is automatically passed. However, if the player has a PA of '-' or if the roll is a natural 1, the test is 'Fumbled', as described on pages 49 and 53.</p>
<h4>Amour Value (AV)</h4>
<p>A player's Armour Value is a hard-working characteristic. Most simply, it represents how the quality and durability of a player's sports kit protects them from harm. But AV can also represent how tough a player is. Some players may appear lightly armoured but have a high AV characteristic, indicating a high degree of physical durability. Others may appear very heavily armoured yet have a low AV characteristic, showing that in spite of their kit, they are delicate and prone to injury!</p>
<h5>Amour Rolls</h5>
<p>Whenever a test is required against a player's Armour Value, it is the coach of the opposing team that makes it. This is referred to as an 'Armour roll'. An Armour roll is a target number roll made on 2D6. If the roll is successful, the player's armour is 'broken'. If the roll is unsuccessful, the player's armour is not broken and protects them from harm.</p>
<h4>Skills &amp; Traits</h4>
<p>In addition to their characteristics, a player may possess one or more Skills or Traits.</p>
<h5>Skills</h5>
<p>Skills improve a player's performance in key areas, be it granting them a free re-roll in specific situations, or allowing them to modify a dice roll. Some players begin their career with natural talents that are represented in this way – others develop new Skills as they improve during a league.</p>
<h5>Traits</h5>
<p>Whilst Skills can be learned by a player during a league, Traits represent a unique ability a player brings to the game. Traits can be both positive and negative. Whatever the case, it is most unusual for a player to develop a new Trait during a league (though not impossible); players possess Traits when hired and retain them over their entire career.</p>
<h4>"What Could Possibly Go Wrong?"</h4>
<p>Players may have an AG or PA of 1+. It might seem that such players cannot fail when testing against these characteristics, but that is, unfortunately, not the case! Remember that when testing against a player's AG or PA, any roll of a natural 1 is a fail. In addition, there will often be modifiers to apply.</p>
<p>For example, a player with an AG of 1+ may find themselves subject to a -2 modifier, in which case you would need to roll a 3 or higher to pass an Agility test, because should you roll a 2 and apply a -2 modifier the result would be 0, which is lower than 1.</p>

                <h3>Drafting a Blood Bowl Team</h3>
<p>Before an aspiring coach can lead their team to glory, the first thing they need is a team to lead! The fundamentals of team creation remain unchanged whether a team is being created for league or exhibition play. The rules that follow explain how to construct a team of players and Sideline Staff, ready to take to the gridiron and seek eternal glory (or ignominy)!</p>
<h4>Team Rosters</h4>
<p>Blood Bowl is a game played by a great variety of races, and these in turn are split into an even greater number of sub-categories. All of these varied teams are represented by 'team rosters', lists used when creating, or 'drafting', a team of that type, which detail the players available to hire, their profiles and Hiring Fee.</p>
<p>A team roster will also tell you how much team re-rolls cost to buy, whether or not the team can include an apothecary, and will list any special rules the team has.</p>
<h5>Special Rules</h5>
<p>Most Blood Bowl teams are quite straight forward in their behaviour and approach to the game. Others, however, are not. All teams have one or more special rules in order to better portray their character (see <a href="#p105">page 105</a>).</p>
<h4>Team Draft Lists</h4>
<p>When a team is drafted, a 'Team Draft list' is completed. This contains spaces in which to record each player permanently hired to the team, their name, position, Hiring Fee and player profile, along with spaces to record experience gained in the form of 'Star Player Points' (see <a href="#p70">page 70</a>) and advancements earned during league play. The 'Current Value' of each player is recorded, which is equal to their Hiring Fee plus the 'Value Increase' of any advancements they accrue (see <a href="#p72">page 72</a>).</p>
<p>There is also space to list other important team details, such as the Sideline Staff permanently hired, the number of team re-rolls bought and how many Dedicated Fans follow the team, as well as the team type, name and the name of the coach.</p>
<p>Finally, the Team Draft list contains spaces to record how many gold pieces the team has in its Treasury (see <a href="#p35">page 35</a>) and the total value of the team when all of the players, Sideline Staff, team re-rolls and player advances are accounted for.</p>
<h5>Game Record Sheet</h5>
<p>The reverse of the Team Draft list features the Game Record sheet. This is used to keep track of 'league fixtures' and 'cross division friendlies' played over the course of a league, including details of opposing teams and the names of their coaches, and the number of fans in attendance along with petty cash awarded, Inducements hired (see <a href="#p38">page 38</a>), Current Team Value and any other notes coaches wish to keep.</p>
<p>Once the game is over, this is also where the outcome is recorded along with winnings and various other notable events as described on <a href="#p69">page 69</a>.</p>

                <h4>Team Draft Budget</h4>
<p>The Team Draft Budget is the amount of gold pieces (GP) you have to spend on your rookie team:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When drafting your team for league play, you have a budget of 1,000,000 gold pieces to spend on players, Sideline Staff, team re-rolls and so forth.</li>
    <li>When drafting a team for exhibition play, you may have a higher budget (see <a href="#p101">page 101</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Hiring Players</h5>
<p>Players are the only compulsory element on any Blood Bowl team. Each team roster details all of the players available to a team of that type and their Hiring Fee. When drafting a team, you should select the players you want to permanently hire for your team, pay their hiring cost from your Team Draft Budget and make a record of the player on the Team Draft list.</p>
<p>A team may not include more players of a certain type than are allowed by the team roster. For example, an Elven Union team is allowed 0-2 Blitzers, meaning an Elven Union team may include zero, one or two Blitzers, but may not include three.</p>
<h5>Number of Players</h5>
<p>The first and most important thing to be aware of when drafting a Blood Bowl team is the minimum and maximum number of players permitted:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Every Blood Bowl team must contain a minimum of eleven (11) permanently hired players when it is first drafted.</li>
    <li>No Blood Bowl team can ever contain more than sixteen (16) permanently hired players.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that, during the course of a league season, the number of players a team can field may fall below 11 due to injury and death. This is permitted (if not ideal!) and is covered in more detail in the Take on Journeymen section on <a href="#p38">page 38</a>.</p>
<h5>Player Positions</h5>
<p>There are distinctions to be made between the players within a team, separating them by their role within the game, from the humble Lineman to the more specialised roles performed by the 'positional' players.</p>
<dl>
    <dd>Linemen</dd>
    <dd>The backbone of any team: All teams will have a player type that they are permitted to take 0-12 or 0-16 of. Regardless of name (for many races call their Linemen by another name), this Player type is the team's 'Lineman' positional.</dd>
    <dt>Blitzers</dt>
    <dd>On offence, Blitzers force gaps through the opposition. In defence they will violently target key opposition players.</dd>
    <dt>Throwers</dt>
    <dd>It is often the Thrower that takes the role of offensive captain – calling the plays and making split second decisions.</dd>
    <dt>Catchers</dt>
    <dd>The safe pair of hands on any team, the Thrower's trusted receivers. It is the Catcher's job to receive passes safely.</dd>
    <dt>Runners</dt>
    <dd>Several teams employ Runners in place of Throwers and Catchers, relying on speed rather than risk passing interference.</dd>
    <dt>Blockers</dt>
    <dd>A popular position on the defensive line of any team that relies on a more physical play-style.</dd>
    <dt>Other Positions</dt>
    <dd>Many teams of different races employ players that do not fit into any specific role. This may be a sneaky Assassin or a Goblin mounted on a pogo stick (it's in the regulations!). There is almost no end to the innovation Blood Bowl teams show.</dd>
    <dt>Big Guys</dt>
    <dd>The term Big Guy is a colloquial one used by Blood Bowl fans to identify the giants of the game; Ogre, Minotaur, Troll players and more fall under this heading.</dd>
</dl>
<h5>Purchasing Team Re-Rolls</h5>
<p>Any team can purchase team re-rolls. These represent the time spent training and the team's ability to react in a split second to mistakes and turn them around. The cost reflects the time and effort different teams must invest to achieve the same broad level of training:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Every team may purchase 0-8 team re-rolls when it is first drafted, for the cost shown on the team roster, paid for from the Team Draft Budget.</li>
    <li>During a league, additional team re-rolls may be purchased at a later date, in the Hiring, Firing and Temporarily Retiring step of the post-game sequence (see <a href="#p72">page 72</a>), but the team must pay double. For example, if a team is able to purchase team re-rolls for 60,000 gold pieces when it is drafted, additional team re-rolls purchased later on during a league season will cost 120,000 gold pieces.</li>
    <li>When calculating Team Value (see <a href="#p35">page 35</a>), team re-rolls add only the cost shown on the team roster, even if they are purchased at double the cost later on in a league.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Hiring Sideline Staff</h5>
<p>Sideline Staff can be of vital assistance to their team, helping to tip the balance in several seemingly minor but often vital ways.</p>
<h6>The Coach</h6>
<p>Every team is owned and managed by a coach. As discussed previously, this is you, the reader. As such, when completing the Team Draft list, the coach section should be filled in with your name or a suitable nickname.</p>
<h6>0-6 Assistant Coaches</h6>
<p>Any team can hire a number of assistant coaches. These represent the specialists brought in to help with various aspects of the game. The benefit of assistant coaches is covered on <a href="#p41">page 41</a>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Every team may hire assistant coaches when it is first drafted, for the cost of 10,000 gold pieces each, paid for from the Team Draft budget.</li>
    <li>Additional assistant coaches may be purchased during a league, in the Hiring, Firing and Temporarily Retiring step of the post-game sequence (see <a href="#p72">page 72</a>), for the cost of 10,000 gold pieces each.</li>
</ul>
<h6>0-12 Cheerleaders</h6>
<p>All teams can hire a number of cheerleaders. Be it dancers, musicians or even performing mascots, a good cheerleading squad can work the crowd up and encourage the players to try harder. The benefit of cheerleaders is covered on <a href="#p41">page 41</a>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Every team may hire cheerleaders when it is first drafted, for the cost of 10,000 gold pieces each, paid for from the Team Draft Budget.</li>
    <li>Additional cheerleaders may be purchased during a league, in the Hiring, Firing and Temporarily Retiring step of the post-game sequence (see <a href="#p72">page 72</a>), for the cost of 10,000 gold pieces each.</li>
</ul>
<h6>0-1 Apothecary</h6>
<p>The apothecary fulfils a vital role in any team. It is their job to keep the valuable players fit and healthy. Apothecaries work hard on the sidelines, patching up minor injuries and giving urgent care to more serious injuries before they can end a player's career. An apothecary's role is covered in detail on <a href="#p62">page 62</a>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Not every team can hire an apothecary. Whether a team can or cannot include an apothecary will be noted on the team roster.</li>
    <li>If a team can hire an apothecary, it may only ever have one on the roster.</li>
    <li>Teams that can hire an apothecary can do so when they are first drafted, or during the Hiring, Firing and Temporarily Retiring step of the post-game sequence of any game (see <a href="#p72">page 72</a>) for a cost of 50,000 gold pieces.</li>
    <li>Teams able to hire an apothecary may Induce a number of additional Wandering Apothecaries for a single game during a league in the Hire Inducements step of the pre-game sequence (see <a href="#p38">page 38</a>).</li>
</ul>

                <h5>Other Information</h5>
<p>As mentioned previously, the Team Draft list contains spaces to record several other important details. This includes the team Treasury, the size of their fan following, and the cash value of the team as a whole.</p>
<h6>Treasury</h6>
<p>Blood Bowl teams can amass vast wealth. Most of this is reinvested immediately into wages, recruitment and running costs, but a careful coach can build up quite the fortune.</p>
<p>Any gold pieces not spent when drafting the team are recorded in the Treasury section of the Team Draft list. Over the course of a league season, winnings are added to this. The Treasury is used to purchase Inducements (see <a href="#p38">page 38</a>) as well as new additions to the team, such as new players or Sideline Staff.</p>
<h6>Dedicated Fans</h6>
<p>Every Blood Bowl team is supported by a strong following of Dedicated Fans, those loyal supporters that will follow their team in good times and bad. This dedicated fan base is made both of those eager to show their support for a local franchise and those from further afield who support the team for less easily identified reasons. Many dedicated fans support a team because their parents did. Others do so simply because they find the team colours fetching.</p>
<p>When a team is drafted, it will have a Dedicated Fans characteristic of 1 recorded on the Team Draft list (representing roughly 1,000 Dedicated Fans). Over the course of a league season, this characteristic will increase and decrease, though it will never fall below 1.</p>
<p>Additionally, when a team is drafted it can improve its Dedicated Fans characteristic by 1, up to a maximum of 6, at a cost of 10,000 gold pieces per improvement. For example, a team may improve its Dedicated Fans characteristic from 1 to 3 at a cost of 20,000 gold pieces from its Team Draft budget.</p>
<h6>Team Value</h6>
<p>The final thing recorded on the Team Draft list is the value of the team:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Team Value (TV)</dt>
    <dd>This is worked out by adding up the Current Value of all the players on the team, plus the cost of all Sideline Staff and team re-rolls the team has. The number of Dedicated Fans and the amount of gold pieces held in the Treasury do not add anything to TV.</dd>
    <dt>Current Team Value (CTV)</dt>
    <dd>This is worked out exactly as above, but minus the Current Value of any players that suffered a Miss Next Game Casualty table result during the team's last game and will be unavailable to play next game (see <a href="#p61">page 61</a>). This is the version of Team Value used to work out how much Petty Cash is granted to the team with the lower value during the pre-game sequence, as described on <a href="#p38">page 38</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Inducements and Teams Drafted for Exhibition Play</h4>
<p>Normally, teams are drafted for league play, and in league play Inducements are dealt with in the pre-game sequence, as described on pages 38 and 89 However, when a team is drafted for exhibition play, this is not the case. Instead, you may spend as much or as little of your Team Draft Budget as you wish on Inducements available to your team, as described on <a href="#p89">page 89</a>, provided your team contains the minimum of 11 players, not including Induced players such as Mercenaries or Star Players.</p>

                                
            </div>
                    <div id="p36" class="page">
                <a href="#p36" class="page-number">#36</a>
                <h2>The Rules of Blood Bowl</h2>
<p>Traditionally, a game of Blood Bowl unfolds with one team kicking the ball to the other. The receiving team, the offence, will then attempt to move the ball the length of the pitch, through a series of dramatic passes and daring rushes, into the opposition's End Zone, thus scoring a touchdown. The team that kicked-off, the defence, will attempt to stop this and gain possession of the ball, so that they may instead score a touchdown.</p>
<p>Once a touchdown has been scored, both of the teams line up once more and the scoring team kick off. And so the game progresses until the final whistle is blown, when the victors celebrate, the losers commiserate and the stadium owners and sports promoters retire to count the money they made from ticket sales and concession stands!</p>

                                
            </div>
                    <div id="p37" class="page">
                <a href="#p37" class="page-number">#37</a>
                <h3>A Game of Two Halves</h3>
<p>A Blood Bowl game is split into two halves of roughly equal length, with a third period played should an important game that needs a clear winner be tied at the end of the second half. The third period is referred to as 'extra time'. In emulation of this tradition, a game of Blood Bowl played on the tabletop is split into two halves, each consisting of eight team turns. Therefore each half consists of 16 turns and the game overall of 32 turns.</p>
<h4>Setting Up The Game</h4>
<p>Setting up a game of Blood Bowl is simple. All that is needed is a pitch and a pair of coaches ready for action, each equipped with a team of models and the appropriate markers. With the pitch placed between them, each coach places their dugout beside one of the End Zones. This indicates which half of the pitch belongs to their team.</p>
<p>Both coaches then place their teams on the pitch and their markers onto their dugout before quickly explaining the details of their team for their opponent's benefit.</p>
<h4>Pre-Game Sequence</h4>
<p>Once the game is set up, the pre-game sequence begins and both coaches run through the following sequence of steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>The Fans:</strong> Both coaches roll a D3 and add their Dedicated Fans characteristic. This determines each team's 'Fan Factor'.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The Weather:</strong> Both coaches roll a D6, adding the results together and consulting the Weather table.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Take on Journeymen:</strong> If a team cannot field 11 players for a league game, the team temporarily takes on a number of Journeyman players.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Inducements:</strong> Both coaches decide if they will purchase any Inducements for the game ahead, paid for from a team's Treasury, from 'Petty Cash', or both.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The Prayers to Nuffle Table:</strong> If one team now has a lower CTV than the other, it may be able to roll on the Prayers to Nuffle table.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Determine Kicking Team:</strong> A coin is flipped or dice are rolled to determine which team will kick-off (play defence) and which will receive (play offence) on the opening drive.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>1. The Fans</h4>
<p>Blood Bowl games are always well attended. As well as the Dedicated Fans, many 'fair-weather fans' come along purely for the spectacle! Though they rarely care much about either team, they will invariably pick one to cheer for.</p>
<h5>Fan Factor</h5>
<p>This is a combination of Dedicated Fans and fair-weather fans in attendance. To determine Fan Factor:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each coach rolls a D3. This represents how many fair-weather fans are cheering for their team.</li>
    <li>Each coach adds their Dedicated Fans characteristic to the number of fair-weather fans cheering their team.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total indicates how many thousands of fans are cheering for your team and should be recorded in the 'FF' (Fan Factor) section of your Game Record sheet.</p>
<h4>2. The Weather</h4>
<p>Blood Bowl is a game played and followed by hardy individuals, so it takes more than a little inclement weather to halt a game! However, extreme weather conditions can have quite an impact upon the game.</p>
<p>Each coach rolls a D6. Add the results together and refer to the Weather table below:</p>

                <h4>3. Take on Journeymen</h4>
<p>If, during the pre-game sequence of a league fixture or cross division friendly, a team is unable to field 11 players it will make use of temporary players known as 'Journeymen':</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Journeyman is always a Lineman positional player, selected from the team's 0-12 or 0-16 option.</li>
    <li>A Journeyman is always a normal player of their type, with the exception that they gain the Loner (4+) trait (see <a href="#p85">page 85</a>), representing their lack of familiarity with their temporary team-mates.</li>
    <li>Journeymen may take the total number of players on the team temporarily above 16 including injured players, but cannot take the number of players available for this game above 11.</li>
    <li>Each Journeyman counts towards CTV. The value they add is equal to the hiring cost of an ordinary player of their type as detailed in the team roster. Once you know how many Journeymen your team will include, you should recalculate your CTV.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a team drafted for exhibition play must contain at least 11 players. This step can be skipped during exhibition play.</p>
<h4>4. Inducements</h4>
<del class="block errata">
    <p>Ahead of any league fixture, play-off season game or cross division friendly, each team can spend gold pieces from their Treasury, from Petty Cash (see below) or from both, to purchase any Inducements available to them. These are then recorded on the team's Game Record sheet.</p>
</del>
<ins class="block errata">
    <p>Ahead of any league fixture, play-off game, or friendly, teams may get the opportunity to spend gold pieces from their Treasury or Petty Cash (or both) to purchase Inducements. If one team has a lower CTV (including the value of any Journeymen players) then it will be given 'petty cash' to spend on Inducements. To work out how much petty cash a team will receive, follow the steps below in order:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The team with the higher CTV gets the opportunity to spend any gold pieces from their Treasury to purchase any Inducements.</li>
        <li>The team with the lower CTV then gets an amount of petty cash equal to the difference in CTV between the two teams, plus an amount equal to the amount of gold the other team spent from its Treasury.</li>
        <li>The team with the lower CTV can then spend this petty cash on Inducements, though any petty cash not spent is lost. They may not spend gold pieces from their Treasury.</li>
    </ul>
</ins>
<p>Note that, as described on <a href="#p102">page 102</a>, Inducements are handled differently in exhibition play.</p>
<h5>Petty Cash</h5>
<p>If one team has a lower CTV (including the value of any Journeymen players), it is given 'petty cash' to spend on Inducements. The amount of petty cash given is exactly equal to the difference in CTV between the two teams. Petty cash cannot be kept; it must be spent on</p>
<p>Inducements for the game ahead. Any gold pieces not spent are lost.</p>
<h5>Treasury</h5>
<p>Both teams are free to spend gold pieces from their Treasury to purchase Inducements. If one of the teams has been given petty cash, gold pieces from its Treasury can be added to this. Gold pieces spent in this way are immediately deducted from the Treasury.</p>
<h5>Common Inducements</h5>
<p>The Inducements available are many and varied. Listed on <a href="#p89">page 89</a> are the 'common' Inducements, always available at the prices shown there. Certain teams will have access to Inducements unique to them and future supplements will detail those and more.</p>
<h5>The Underdog</h5>
<p>Once finished purchasing Inducements, you should recalculate your CTV. If at this point one team has a lower CTV, that team is referred to as the 'Underdog' and its coach may be eligible to appeal for 'divine intervention' by rolling on the Prayers to Nuffle table in Step 5.</p>
<h4>5. The Prayers to Nuffle Table</h4>
<p>In league play (but not in exhibition play), the Prayers to Nuffle table may often be used during this step of the pre-game sequence. In both league and exhibition play, it may sometimes be used at the start of a drive, as described on <a href="#p41">page 41</a>.</p>
<p>During this step of the pre-game sequence, the coach of the Underdog team may roll once on the Prayers to Nuffle table for every full 50,000 gold pieces of difference in CTV.</p>
<p>Roll a D16 and consult the table on the page opposite, re-rolling any duplicate results, and make a note of the result(s). All results rolled on this table come into effect at the start of the next drive. Most results last until the end of the next drive (i.e., the drive which starts immediately after this roll is made), then they cease to apply. Others last until the end of the half and a few results last until the end of the game.</p>
<h4>6. Determine Kicking Team</h4>
<p>Every game of Blood Bowl starts with a coin toss to determine which team will be the 'kicking team' (the defence) and which team will be the 'receiving team' (the offence). In a real Blood Bowl game, this simple ceremony is much beloved of Blood Bowl fans as it is invariably when violence first breaks out between the teams, the fans and, quite often, the officials!</p>
<p>On the tabletop, this ritual can be recreated either by tossing a Blood Bowl coin, or by a D6 roll-off. Once it has been determined which is the kicking team and which is the receiving team, the opening drive of the game begins in earnest with the set-up and kick-off as described on <a href="#p40">page 40</a>.</p>

                <h3>The Start of a Drive</h3>
<p>Once the coin toss or roll-off to determine which team will kick and which will receive is resolved, the coaches will take turns to set up their teams, ready for action and with the shouted instructions of coaching staff ringing in their ears. The coach of the kicking team then places the ball, determines how accurate (or how wildly inaccurate) the kick is, and rolls on the Kick-off Event table.</p>
<h4>Start of Drive Sequence</h4>
<p>At the beginning of every drive, both coaches run through the following sequence of steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Set-Up:</strong> Starting with the kicking team, both coaches set up their teams.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The Kick-Off:</strong> A player on the kicking team kicks the ball to the offence.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The Kick-Off Event:</strong> The coach of the kicking team rolls on the Kick-off Event table.
    </li>
</ol>
<h5>Too Many Players</h5>
<p>Sometimes, too many players will make their way onto the pitch. If this is spotted before the first turn of the drive, simply correct the mistake. If, however, the mistake is not spotted until after the first turn of the drive has begun, any extra player(s) will be Sent-off for committing a Foul, exactly as described on <a href="#p63">page 63</a>. Which player(s) are Sent-off is decided by the coach of the opposing team.</p>
<h4>1. Set-up</h4>
<p>Both coaches place all of their available players on the pitch. If there are more than 11 players available, those not chosen to play the drive are placed in the Reserves box until the start of the next drive. A team may not set up more than 11 players at the start of a drive.</p>
<p>In later drives, the number of available players is likely to be reduced, with players languishing in the Knocked-out or the Casualty box. This is permitted, if not ideal! If you are unable to set up 11 players at the start of a later drive, you must set up all available players – no players can be placed in the Reserves box if fewer than 11 players are available.</p>
<p>The kicking team set up first, followed by the receiving team, as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Both teams set up fully within the area between their own End Zone and the Line of Scrimmage. Neither team may set up any players beyond the Line of Scrimmage in the opposition's half.</li>
    <li>Each team can set up a maximum of two players in each Wide Zone. In other words, each team can set up four players in Wide Zones, providing they are split equally with two players per Widezone.</li>
    <li>A team must set up a minimum of three players in squares within the Centre Field, directly adjacent to the Line of Scrimmage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that should a team find itself reduced to only three players or fewer, it may concede without penalty before setting-up, as described on <a href="#p67">page 67</a>. Should you wish to play on, the available players should be set up on the Line of Scrimmage, as described above.</p>
<h4>2. The Kick-off</h4>
<p>Once both teams have been set-up ready for the drive ahead, the coach of the kicking team makes the kick-off.</p>
<h5>Nominate kicking player</h5>
<p>Although not always essential, certain rules require a specific player to be nominated as the kicking player. It is therefore useful to adopt the habit of nominating a kicking player:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The kicking player cannot be on the Line of Scrimmage (unless there are only three, or fewer, players belonging to their team on the pitch).</li>
    <li>The kicking player cannot be in either Wide Zone.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Place the kick</h5>
<p>A good kick can help the defence and hinder the offence, and where to place the ball is an important consideration when kicking. The coach of the kicking team places the ball in any square they wish, occupied or unoccupied, in the receiving team's half of the pitch.</p>
<h5>The Kick Deviates</h5>
<p>Kicking the ball is not a precise art, and a bad kick can see the ball land wildly off target. The coach of the kicking team rolls both a D8 and a D6 to determine deviation, as described on <a href="#p25">page 25</a>. At this moment, the ball itself is still high in the air. No attempts can be made to catch it until after the 'kick-off event' has been resolved.</p>

</div>
                <div class="designers-commentary-qa-answer"><p>No. The Too Many Players rule is used when there are more players than the team is allowed on the pitch (usually 11). The Swarming trait increases the number of players that team is allowed to field by D3 for the duration of the drive so, as long as the team does not exceed the new limit, their players cannot be Sent-off for Too Many Players. If there are any players fielded above the new limit for the Swarming team, they can be Sent-off for Too Many Players as normal.</p>

                <h4>3. The Kick-Off Event</h4>
<p>Every kick-off is a unique event. Almost anything can happen, and often does!</p>
<p>Immediately after the kick has deviated, whilst the ball is still high in the air, the coach of the kicking team rolls 2D6 and consults the Kick-off Event table opposite.</p>
<h5>What goes up, must come down</h5>
<p>Once the Kick-off event has been resolved, the ball will come back down to be caught by a player or to land on the ground, as described on <a href="#p25">page 25</a>.</p>
<h5>Touchbacks</h5>
<p>A kick-off must land safely in the receiving team's half of the pitch. If the ball deviates or bounces off the pitch or across the Line of Scrimmage into the kicking team's half of the pitch for any reason at all, a 'touchback' is caused. When a touchback is caused, after the Kick-off event has been resolved as normal, the coach of the receiving team gives possession of the ball to one of their players. No Agility test is required, the player is simply handed the ball. Should it ever occur that there is no Standing player on the receiving team to take possession of the ball, the ball is given to a Prone or Stunned player and will bounce.</p>

                <h3>The Team Turn</h3>
<p>A game of Blood Bowl is a hectic affair, and to make sense of all of the action, the game on the tabletop is broken down into a series of team turns, during which each coach will activate their players one at a time. In this way, the drama of the game is recreated in a manageable and controlled way.</p>
<h4>Team Turns</h4>
<p>Once the Kick-off has been resolved, the game continues in a simple but strict sequence of team turns:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Receiving Team's Turn:</strong> At the start of any drive the receiving team, the offence, takes the first team turn.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Kicking Team's Turn:</strong> After the receiving team have taken their turn, play passes to the team that kicked, the defence.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>This sequence is repeated until the drive ends with a touchdown, the end of a half or the end of the game:</p>
<ul>
    <li>At the beginning of the first half, which team kicks-off and which team receives will have been decided by the coin toss, as described on <a href="#p38">page 38</a>.</li>
    <li>At the beginning of the second half, play is reversed, with the team that received and played offence at the start of the game now becoming the kicking team, and vice versa.</li>
    <li>Should any drive end with a touchdown before the end of the half, the team that scored the touchdown will kick to the team that conceded the touchdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>A team turn ends either once all eligible players have been activated, or as the result of a Turnover (see <a href="#p23">page 23</a>).</p>
<h5>Active and Inactive Team</h5>
<p>During your team turn, your team is referred to as the 'active' team. During your team turn, your opponent's team is referred to as the 'opposition' or the 'inactive' team.</p>
<h4>Moving the Turn Marker</h4>
<p>As mentioned previously, it is your responsibility at the beginning of each and every one of your team turns to move the turn marker along the Turn tracker on your dugout. If either coach forgets to move their turn marker, a polite reminder to do so is in order.</p>
<h4>Player Activations</h4>
<p>During your team turn, you may activate each Standing and/or Prone player to perform one action available to them, but you are not obliged to activate every player. Players that begin their team turn Stunned cannot be activated. In ideal circumstances, you will be able to activate every player without mishap, but all too often a turn will end with a Turnover, meaning that some players will inevitably not have been activated when the turn ends.</p>
<h5>Declaring Actions</h5>
<p>When you activate a player, you must declare the action that player will perform (and, if required, the target of that action). You may not move a player and then declare that player will perform a Pass, Throw Team-Mate, Hand-off, Blitz or Foul action. If a player is moved without first declaring their action, the player can only perform a simple Move action.</p>
<p>You are never obliged to complete a declared action. For example, if you declare a player will perform a Pass action, you may decide against performing the Pass action itself once movement is complete. If, after moving, you decide against performing the declared action, the action still counts as having been performed this team turn and cannot be performed by another player.</p>

<p>The most basic action. Any player on the active team that is not Stunned can perform a simple Move action. Movement is covered in more detail on <a href="#p44">page 44</a>.</p>
<h6>Pass</h6>
<p>Once per team turn, a player on the active team may attempt to pass the ball to another square, as described on <a href="#p48">page 48</a>.</p>
<h6>Hand-Off</h6>
<p>Once per team turn, a player on the active team may attempt to hand the ball off to another Standing player from their team that is in an adjacent square, as described on <a href="#p51">page 51</a>.</p>
<h6>Throw Team-Mate</h6>
<p>Once per team turn, instead of performing an ordinary Pass action, a player on the active team with the 'Throw Team-Mate' trait may attempt to throw a player from their team that has the 'Right Stuff' trait. A team may not perform both a Pass action and a Throw Team-Mate action during the same team turn. Throwing team-mates is covered in more detail on <a href="#p52">page 52</a>.</p>
<h6>Block</h6>
<p>'Block' is the term used when a player targets an opposition player with an attack, hoping to push them back, knock them to the ground and perhaps cause a lasting injury. A Standing player on the active team can target a Standing opposition player that is within their Tackle Zone with a Block action (or a Special action granted by a Skill or Trait that can be performed instead of a Block action), but cannot move before or after performing the action. Blocking is covered in more detail on <a href="#p56">page 56</a>.</p>
<h6>Blitz</h6>
<p>Once per team turn, a player on the active team may perform a Blitz action, an action that combines together both a Move action and a Block action (or a Special action granted by a Skill or Trait that can be performed instead of a Block action). When a player performs a Blitz action, they may move as normal. However, performing the Block action costs a Blitzing player one square of their Movement Allowance. The player may move both before and after performing the Block action if they wish, and may follow-up if the target of the Block action is pushed back. Movement is covered in more detail on <a href="#p44">page 44</a> and Blocking is covered in more detail on <a href="#p56">page 56</a>.</p>
<h6>Foul</h6>
<p>Once per team turn, a player on the active team may commit a Foul action, stealthily sticking the boot into a downed opponent when they hope no one is looking! Fouling is covered in more detail on <a href="#p63">page 63</a>, but be warned that such flagrant disregard for the rules may result in the active player being Sent-off and the team turn ending with a Turnover.</p>
<h6>Special Actions</h6>
<p>In addition to these seven main actions, there are numerous Skills and Traits a player may possess that allow them to perform another, unique action. Examples include Hypnotic Gaze, which allows a player to transfix an opponent, causing them to temporarily lose their Tackle Zone so that they cannot Mark other players.</p>
<p>Such actions are called 'Special actions' and are detailed in the appropriate Skill or Trait description. A full list of Skills, Traits and descriptions of how they work can be found on <a href="#p74">page 74</a>.</p>
<h4>Activated Players</h4>
<p>During a game of Blood Bowl, it can become difficult to keep track of which players have already been activated during their team turn, and which players are yet to be activated.</p>
<p>To help with this, at the start of each team turn you should make sure that all of your players are facing towards the same End Zone. Once a player has been activated, the model should be turned around, so that it is facing towards the other End Zone. In this way, both coaches are able to tell easily which players have been activated and which players have yet to be activated.</p>
<p>A Standing player that loses their Tackle Zone should be turned to face one of the Sidelines. The player should be left facing the Sideline until their next activation begins.</p>

                <h3>Movement</h3>
<p>During their team turn, a number of actions allow a player to move about the pitch when activated, as mentioned previously. Sometimes a player may even be moved involuntarily as a result of a block or another in-game effect. This section deals with how players are moved around the pitch and how other players, particularly the opposition, can hinder their progress.</p>
<h4>Moving Players</h4>
<p>When a player moves, they may move a number of squares equal to their Movement Allowance. A player may move in any direction: forwards, backwards, left, right and diagonally, into any adjacent, unoccupied square. Moving players are not obliged to use their full Movement Allowance and may move zero squares should you wish. Players cannot voluntarily move off the pitch</p>
<h5>Unoccupied Squares</h5>
<p>Any square that is not occupied is said to be 'unoccupied'. Players may move into any unoccupied square that is adjacent to the square they occupy. Only players can occupy a square, if a square contains only the ball or a trapdoor, it is unoccupied.</p>
<h5>Occupied Squares</h5>
<p>If there is a Standing, Prone or Stunned player from either team in a square, that square is said to be 'occupied'. Players may not move into or through an occupied square. The ball can never come to rest on the ground in an occupied square and will continue to bounce until it lands in an unoccupied square or is caught by a Standing player.</p>
<h5>Standing Up</h5>
<p>A Prone player can do nothing without first standing up. A Prone player can stand up when they are activated to perform any action that includes movement:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The only time a Prone player can stand up is during their team turn, at the start of their activation.</li>
    <li>Standing up costs a Prone player three (3) squares of their Movement Allowance.</li>
    <li>If a Prone Player with a Movement Allowance of 2 or less (before or after modification) wishes to stand up, roll a D6:
        <ul>
            <li>On a roll of 4+, the player is able to stand up, using their full Movement Allowance to do so.</li>
            <li>On a roll of 1-3, the player is unable to right themselves. They remain Prone and their activation ends.</li>
            <li>A Prone player with a Movement Allowance of 2 or less (before or after modification) may Rush after standing up.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If a Prone player is not activated during their team turn, they will remain Prone until they are activated in a later turn.</p>
<h5>Rushing</h5>
<p>Whenever a player performs any action that includes movement, they may attempt to gain an extra one or two squares of Movement Allowance. This is called 'Rushing'. These extra squares of Movement Allowance may be used to move, to perform a Block action as part of a Blitz action (see <a href="#p59">page 59</a>), to Jump over a Prone or Stunned player (see <a href="#p45">page 45</a>) and so on, just as if they were normal movement:</p>
<ul>
    <li>At the end of the player's movement, declare that they will Rush and move them one more square.</li>
    <li>After the Rushing player has been moved, roll a D6:
        <ul>
            <li>On a roll of 2+, the Rushing player moves without mishap.</li>
            <li>On a roll of 1 (before or after modification), the Rushing player trips and Falls Over as described on <a href="#p27">page 27</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If the Rushing player is still Standing after Rushing once, they may attempt to Rush a second time following the same process.</p>
<p>When a player is Rushing, the D6 roll comes before any other rolls that may be required, be they to Dodge, pick up the ball or anything else.</p>

                <h5>Marked Players and Dodging</h5>
<p>If an active player is being Marked, as described on <a href="#p26">page 26</a>, by one or more opposition players, they must 'Dodge' in order to vacate the square they currently occupy and move safely into another, otherwise they will be tackled and will Fall Over in the square they wish to move into.</p>
<p>To Dodge, a player must test against their Agility as described on <a href="#p29">page 29</a>. Declare that the player will Dodge from the square in which they are being Marked, and move them into any adjacent, unoccupied square:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Agility test is made after the dodging player has been moved, Rushing first if necessary.</li>
    <li>No matter how many players were Marking them, the dodging player is only required to make one Agility test to Dodge.</li>
    <li>If the dodging player is being Marked in the square they have moved into, apply a -1 modifier per player Marking them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if the player is Open in the square they have moved into, there are no modifiers to apply for being Marked. However, there may be modifiers to apply for other reasons, such as Skills and Traits being used by an opposing player.</p>
<h5>Open Players</h5>
<p>A player that is Open does not need to Dodge to move from square to square. An Open player may move into an unoccupied square that is within the Tackle Zone of one or more opposition players, so that they are now Marking those players and being Marked by them in turn. The moving player may then stop moving or may continue to move, but will have to Dodge as described above.</p>
<h4>Jumping Over Stunned Players</h4>
<p>Once during their activation, a moving player can attempt to Jump over a single adjacent square that is occupied by a Prone or Stunned player, into an unoccupied square beyond. The squares the active player can attempt to Jump into will depend upon the direction in which they are moving, as shown in the diagrams below:</p>
<p>
    <img src="./images/jumping-prone.jpg" width="426" height="196">
</p>
<p>Jumping over a square in this way uses Movement Allowance exactly as if the player had moved into and out of the square they are jumping over. To Jump over a square that contains a Prone or Stunned player, a player must test against their Agility as described on <a href="#p29">page 29</a>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Agility test is made after the jumping player has been moved, Rushing first if necessary.</li>
    <li>Apply a negative modifier equal to the number of players that were Marking the jumping player in the square they jumped from or equal to the number of players that are Marking the jumping player in the square they have jumped into, whichever is the greatest. For example, if a player jumps from a square in which they were being Marked by one player into a square in which they are being Marked by two players, a -2 modifier is applied.</li>
    <li>If the jumping player was being Marked in the square they jumped from, they are not required to Dodge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if the jumping player was Open in the square they have jumped from and is Open in the square they have jumped into, there are no modifiers to apply for being Marked. However, there may be modifiers to apply for other reasons.</p>
<p>If the Agility test is failed, the jumping player will Fall Over in the square they have jumped into. If, however, the Agility test is failed on a natural 1, the jumping player is placed back in the s</p>

                <h4>Blitz Actions</h4>
<p>Once per team turn, as mentioned on <a href="#p43">page 43</a>, a single Standing or Prone player on the active team may be activated to perform a Blitz action. When a player Blitzes, they may move exactly as described in this section; standing up and dodging as necessary, and they may attempt to gain extra squares of Movement Allowance by Rushing. In addition, they may perform a Block action (or a Special action granted by a Skill or Trait that can be performed instead of a Block action) at any point before, during or after their movement. The only notable difference is that when a player Blitzes, performing a Block action (or a Special action granted by a Skill or Trait that can be performed instead of a Block action) costs the player one square of their Movement Allowance.</p>
<p>Block actions and Blitz actions are covered in greater detail on <a href="#p56">page 56</a>.</p>
<h4>Picking Up the Ball</h4>
<p>If a player voluntarily moves into a square in which the ball is placed, they must attempt to pick it up. This attempt to pick up the ball is made after any dice rolls required to Rush, Dodge or Jump into the square have been made, but before any other dice rolls are made.</p>
<p>To pick up the ball, a player must test against their Agility as described on <a href="#p29">page 29</a>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the player is Open when attempting to pick up the ball, there are no modifiers to apply.</li>
    <li>If the player is being Marked, apply a -1 modifier per player Marking them.</li>
    <li>If a player attempts to pick up the ball and fails, the ball will bounce as described on <a href="#p25">page 25</a>. Should this happen, a Turnover is caused, even if the bounce is caught by another player on the active team.</li>
</ul>
<p>After successfully picking up the ball, the player may continue moving if they wish and if they are able.</p>
<p>Note that should a player ever be moved involuntarily into a square in which the ball is placed, they cannot attempt to pick it up. Instead the ball will bounce, but no Turnover is caused.</p>

                <h3>Passing the Ball</h3>
<p>Traditionally in Blood Bowl, play progresses with a series of dramatic passes and catches. Throwers endeavour to get the ball safely to a team-mate, who, thanks to their strength, speed and agility, is in position to run with the ball into the opposition End Zone. Whilst in recent years many players that prefer to run with the ball have risen to superstardom, it is still the spectacle of the passing game that excites the crowds the most!</p>
<h4>Pass Actions</h4>
<p>Once per team turn, a player on the active team may perform a Pass action in order to pass the ball to another square. This target square may be occupied by a Standing, Prone or Stunned player (from either team) or it may be unoccupied.</p>
<p>A Pass action can be further defined as being a 'Quick pass', a 'Short pass', a 'Long pass' or a 'Long bomb', based on the range as described opposite.</p>
<p>The player may move before performing the action following all of the normal movement rules, but once the pass has been resolved they may not move further and their activation comes to an end. The player performing the action does not need to be in possession of the ball when activated, they may pick the ball up as they move (see <a href="#p46">page 46</a>):</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Measure Range and Declare Target Square:</dt>
    <dd> The range ruler is used to measure the range to any possible target squares, before the target square is chosen and declared.</dd>
    <dt>Test For Accuracy:</dt>
    <dd> The coach of the player performing the action rolls a D6 to determine the accuracy of the pass.</dd>
    <dt>Passing Interference:</dt>
    <dd> Unless the pass was fumbled, one opposition player may be able to attempt to interfere with the pass, hoping to 'Deflect' or 'Intercept' it.</dd>
    <dt>Resolve Pass Action:</dt>
    <dd> If the pass was neither fumbled nor interfered with, the pass itself is resolved!</dd>
</dl>
<h5>Measure Range and Declare Target Square</h5>
<p>Once you have activated a player and declared that they will perform a Pass action, you are free to measure the range between the player and any possible target squares whenever you wish, even interrupting the player's movement to do so.</p>
<h6>Measuring Range</h6>
<p>Range is measured by placing the circle at the end of the range ruler over the centre of the square occupied by the player performing the action. The other end of the range ruler is positioned so that the ruler covers the target square, with the line along the centre of the range ruler passing through the centre of the target square. The target square will fall into one of the four bands marked on the range ruler:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I: Quick pass</li>
    <li>II: Short pass</li>
    <li>III: Long pass</li>
    <li>IIII: Long bomb</li>
</ul>
<p>Any squares that are beyond the reach of the range ruler or that are intersected by the end of the range ruler are out of range and cannot be the target square. If the line between two range bands intersects the target square, it is considered to fall within the higher range band. If it is not clear which range band the target square falls into, refer to the Passing Range chart shown below:</p>
<p>

</p>
<h5>Declare Target Square</h5>
<p>After you have measured for range and moved the player, you must indicate and declare which square will be the target square. The target square may be occupied by a Standing, Prone or Stunned player (from either team) or it may be unoccupied.</p>

                <h5>Test For Accuracy</h5>
<p>The player performing the action now tests against their Passing Ability to see if the pass is 'accurate', 'inaccurate', 'wildly inaccurate' or is 'fumbled'. A Passing Ability test is made as described on <a href="#p29">page 29</a>, applying the following modifiers based on range:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the player is attempting a Quick pass, there is no modifier.</li>
    <li>If the player is attempting a Short pass, apply a -1 modifier.</li>
    <li>If the player is attempting a Long pass, apply a -2 modifier.</li>
    <li>If the player is attempting a Long bomb, apply a -3 modifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the following modifiers may also apply:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the player is being Marked, apply an additional -1 modifier per player Marking them.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Accurate Passes</h6>
<p>If the Passing Ability test is passed, or if the roll is a natural 6, the pass is accurate and the ball will land in the target square.</p>
<h6>Inaccurate Passes</h6>
<p>If the Passing Ability test is failed, the pass is inaccurate and the ball will scatter from the target square before landing.</p>
<h6>Wildly Inaccurate Passes</h6>
<p>If, when making the Passing Ability test, the dice roll is a 1 after modifiers have been applied, the ball will deviate from the square occupied by the player performing the Pass action before landing.</p>
<h6>Fumbled Passes</h6>
<p>There is always a chance something will go horribly wrong and the pass will be fumbled:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If, when making the Passing Ability test, a natural 1 is rolled, the pass has been fumbled.</li>
    <li>If the player has a PA of '-', the pass is automatically fumbled.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a Pass action is fumbled, the activation of the player performing it ends immediately. The ball is dropped, bouncing from the square occupied by the player performing the action, and a Turnover is caused.</p>

                <h5>Passing Interference</h5>
<p>If the pass was not fumbled, a single player from the opposing team may be able to attempt to interfere with the pass, hoping to 'Deflect' the pass or, in some rare cases, to 'Intercept' the pass. To determine if any opposition players are able to attempt passing interference, place the range ruler so that the circle at the end is over the centre of the square occupied by the player performing the Pass action. Position the other end so that the ruler covers the square in which the ball will land. Note that, depending upon the Passing Ability test, this may not be the target square!</p>
<p>To attempt to interfere with a pass, an opposition player must be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Standing player that has not lost their Tackle Zone (as described on <a href="#p26">page 26</a>).</li>
    <li>Occupying a square that is between the square occupied by the player performing the Pass action and the square in which the ball will land.</li>
    <li>In a square that is at least partially beneath the range ruler when placed as described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <img src="./images/passing-interference.jpg" width="316" height="248">
</p>
<p>If any opposition players are in a position to attempt to interfere with a pass, the coach of the opposing team nominates one to make the attempt and tests against their Agility, applying the following modifiers to represent the difficulty of attempting to snatch the ball from the air:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the player is attempting to interfere with an accurate pass, apply a -3 modifier.</li>
    <li>If the player is attempting to interfere with an inaccurate pass, apply a -2 modifier.</li>
    <li>If the player is attempting to interfere with a wildly inaccurate pass, apply a -1 modifier.</li>
    <li>Apply an additional -1 modifier if the player is being Marked.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Successful Passing Interference</h6>
<p>If the Agility test is passed, the player's attempt to interfere with the pass has been successful and the pass has been 'Deflected'. The pass is interrupted and the action immediately ends.</p>
<p>The player that made the Deflection must now attempt to convert that Deflection into an 'Interception' by catching the ball as described opposite. If they do, they have made an Interception. If the player fails to catch the ball, it will scatter from the square they occupy.</p>
<p>Following any successful passing interference, if the ball comes to rest on the ground in an empty square or in the possession of a player from the opposing team, a Turnover is caused. If, however, the ball is caught by a player on the active team after scattering, no Turnover is caused.</p>
<h5>Resolve Pass Action</h5>
<p>If the pass was neither successfully interfered with nor fumbled, the pass itself is now resolved. Where the ball lands is determined based on the result of the Passing Ability test as described previously. If the ball lands in a square occupied by a Standing player that has not lost their Tackle Zone, that player must attempt to catch it, as described opposite. If no player on the active team catches the ball after a Pass action and the ball comes to rest on the ground or in the possession of a player from the inactive team, a Turnover is caused.</p>

                <h4>Catching the Ball</h4>
<p>There are many instances when the rules will call upon a player to attempt to catch the ball. A player that is able to catch the ball must attempt to do so, even if their coach does not want that player to catch the ball!</p>
<p>To catch the ball, a player must test against their Agility as described on <a href="#p29">page 29</a>, applying the following modifiers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the player is attempting to catch an accurate pass or a Hand-off (see <a href="#p49">page 49</a> and below), there are no modifiers.</li>
    <li>If the player is attempting to convert a Deflection into an Interception, apply a -1 modifier.</li>
    <li>If the player is attempting to catch a bouncing ball, apply a -1 modifier.</li>
    <li>If the player is attempting to catch a ball that has been thrown-in by the crowd (see opposite), apply a -1 modifier.</li>
    <li>If the player is attempting to catch a ball that has scattered or deviated into the square they occupy, apply a -1 modifier.</li>
</ul>
<p> In addition to the above, the following modifiers may also apply:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the player is being Marked, apply an additional -1 modifier per player Marking them.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hand-off</h4>
<p>In addition to performing a Pass action, once per team turn a player on the active team may perform a Hand-off action and simply hand the ball to a Standing team-mate in an adjacent square. The player may move before performing the Hand-off action following all of the normal movement rules, but once the action has been made and the ball handed to a team-mate, their activation comes to an end and they cannot move further. As with passing, the player performing the Hand-off action does not need to be in possession of the ball when activated, they may pick it up as they move (see <a href="#p46">page 46</a>).</p>
<p>A Hand-off action is not a Pass action, and there is no test required to perform the action itself and even a player with a PA of '-' may perform a Hand-off action. The player performing the action simply needs to be in possession of the ball. The player receiving the ball, however, must test against their Agility to catch it, as described above.</p>
<h4>Throw-ins</h4>
<p>Should the ball leave the pitch at any time, the crowd will throw it back into play. This is done using the Throw-in template:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Position the Throw-in template (as shown in the diagram below) with the Blood Bowl logo over the last square the ball occupied before leaving the pitch and roll a D6 to determine the direction the ball travels in.</li>
    <li>When the ball is thrown-in by the crowd, it travels 2D6 squares from the last square it occupied before leaving the pitch, in the direction indicated by the Throw-in template, before landing.</li>
    <li>If the ball lands in a square that is occupied by a Standing player that has not lost their Tackle Zone, that player must attempt to catch it. If they fail, or if the ball lands in an unoccupied square or a square that is occupied either by a Standing player that has lost their Tackle Zone or by a Prone or Stunned player, it will bounce before it comes to rest on the ground.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should the ball leave the pitch again following an over-enthusiastic throw-in, repeat the above process.</p>
<p>
    <img src="./images/throw-ins.jpg" width="316" height="199">
</p>
<h5>Corner Throw-ins</h5>
<p>Should the ball leave the pitch from a corner square, the direction of the throw-in is determined by placing the Random Direction template, as shown in the diagram on <a href="#p21">page 21</a>, and rolling a D3.</p>

                <h3>Throwing other Players</h3>
<p>One tactic that has proven a hit with fans the world over is one that seems to have been first employed in aggression, rather than as a cunning way to score. In the old days, it was not uncommon for Big Guy players to pick up particularly diminutive opponents and simply toss them into the waiting crowds! These days it is normal to see a Big Guy pitching a puny pal towards the opposition End Zone… or simply forgetting what's going on and eating them!</p>
<h4>Throw Team-Mate Actions</h4>
<p>Once per team turn, instead of performing a Pass action, a player on the active team with the 'Throw Team-Mate' trait can attempt to throw a team-mate with the 'Right Stuff' trait as if they were a ball. The target square of a Throw Team-Mate action may be occupied or unoccupied and the action can be further defined as being a 'Quick Throw' or a 'Short Throw', based on the range. Unlike a Pass action, a Throw Team-Mate action that is not fumbled will always scatter before landing.</p>
<p>If the player to be thrown is Standing, they can attempt to land safely after being thrown (see <a href="#p54">page 54</a>). If they are Prone or Stunned, they can still be thrown but cannot land safely.</p>
<p>The player performing the action may move first following all of the normal movement rules, but must be in a square adjacent to the player they wish to throw when the throw is made; they cannot pick up and carry a team-mate before throwing them. Once the throw has been resolved, they may not move further and their activation comes to an end:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Measure Range and Declare Target Square:</strong> The range ruler may be used to determine the range between the throwing player and any possible target squares, before the target square is chosen and declared.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Test For Quality:</strong> The coach of the player performing the action rolls a D6 to determine the quality of the throw.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Resolve Throw:</strong> Where the thrown player lands, and how easily, depends upon the quality of the throw. If the throw is fumbled, the thrown player is dropped and will bounce.
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Measure Range and Declare Target Square</h5>
<p>As with a Pass action, once the player performing the Throw Team-Mate action has been activated and the action declared, you are free to measure the range between the player and any possible target squares whenever you wish, even interrupting the player's movement to do so.</p>
<h6>Measuring Range</h6>
<p>When throwing a team-mate, range is measured using the range ruler exactly as described on <a href="#p48">page 48</a>. However, when throwing a team-mate, only half of the range ruler is used. Therefore the target square will fall into one of the two bands marked on the first half of the range ruler:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>I:</strong> Quick throw
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>II:</strong> Short throw
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Any squares that are beyond the reach of the range ruler or that are intersected by the end of the range ruler are out of range and cannot be the target square. If the line between the two range bands intersects the target square, the target square is considered to be within the higher range band. If it is not clear which range band the target square falls into, refer to the Throw Range chart shown below:</p>
<p>
    <img src="./images/throw-team-mate-measuring-range.jpg" width="315" height="266">
</p>
<h6>Declare the Target Square</h6>
<p>Once range has been measured and the player performing the action has completed their movement, the target square is declared. The target square must be in range and may be occupied or unoccupied.</p>

                                
            </div>
                    <div id="p53" class="page">
                <a href="#p53" class="page-number">#53</a>
                <h5>Test for Quality</h5>
<p>Once the range has been measured and the target square declared, a Passing Ability test is made to determine if the throw is 'superb', 'successful', 'terrible' or is 'fumbled'. The player performing the action makes a Passing Ability test as described on <a href="#p29">page 29</a>, applying the following modifiers based on range:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the player is attempting a quick throw, there is no modifier.</li>
    <li>If the player is attempting a short throw, apply a -1 modifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, the following modifiers may also apply:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the player is being Marked, apply an additional -1 modifier per player Marking them.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Superb Throws</h6>
<p>If the Passing Ability test is passed, or if the roll is a natural 6, the throw is superb. After scattering, the thrown player will find it easier to land.</p>
<h6>Successful Throws</h6>
<p>If the Passing Ability test is failed, the throw is still successful. After scattering, the thrown player will find it harder to land.</p>
<h6>Terrible Throws</h6>
<p>If, when making the Passing Ability test, the dice roll is a 1 after modifiers have been applied, the thrown player will deviate from the square occupied by the player performing the Throw action before landing.</p>
<h6>Fumbled Throws</h6>
<p>Often, smaller players object to being thrown and will squirm a bit. When they do, there is a chance that the throw will be fumbled:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If, when making the Passing Ability test, a natural 1 is rolled, the throw has been fumbled.</li>
    <li>If the player performing the Throw Team-Mate action has a PA of '-', the throw is automatically fumbled.</li>
</ul>
<p> When a Throw Team-Mate action is fumbled, the action is unsuccessful and the activation of the player performing it ends immediately. The player that was to be thrown is dropped and will bounce (as if they were a ball) from the square occupied by the player performing the action, after which they must attempt to land, as described on <a href="#p54">page 54</a>.</p>

                                
            </div>
                    <div id="p54" class="page">
                <a href="#p54" class="page-number">#54</a>
                <h6>Resolve Throw Team-Mate Action</h6>
<p>A Throw Team-Mate action cannot be interfered with. Therefore, if the throw was not fumbled, the throw itself is now resolved. The thrown player must now attempt to land, as described below, hopefully on their feet!</p>
<h4>Landing</h4>
<p>If the thrown player was Standing and had not lost their Tackle Zone before they were thrown, and if the player lands in an unoccupied square, they will attempt to land safely. To land safely, the thrown player must pass an Agility test, applying the following modifiers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the throw was superb, there are no modifiers.</li>
    <li>If the throw was fumbled, apply a -1 modifier.</li>
    <li>If the throw was successful, apply a -1 modifier.</li>
    <li>If the throw was terrible, apply a -2 modifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the following modifiers may also apply:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the player is being Marked in the square they land in, apply an additional -1 modifier per player Marking them.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Agility test is passed, or if the roll is a natural 6, the thrown player will land safely and is considered to have moved voluntarily.</p>
<p>If the Agility test is failed, the thrown player will land badly and is considered to have moved involuntarily. The thrown player will Fall Over, as described on <a href="#p27">page 27</a>. If the thrown player was in possession of the ball, a Turnover is caused. Otherwise, no Turnover is caused.</p>
<p>If the thrown player has not yet been activated this turn, they may be activated later in the turn if possible, i.e., if they are not Stunned after a traumatic landing.</p>
<h5>Landing in an Occupied Square</h5>
<del class="block errata">
    <p>If after the scatter has been resolved, the thrown player lands in an occupied square:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The player occupying the square is Knocked Down (an Armour roll and possible Injury roll is made against them even if they were already Prone or Stunned).</li>
        <li>The thrown player will bounce (as if they were a ball) from the square they land in and will automatically Fall Over upon landing, as described on <a href="#p27">page 27</a>.</li>
        <li>Should the thrown player bounce into another occupied square, the above process is repeated.</li>
    </ul>
</del>
<ins class="block errata">
    <p>If after the scatter has been resolved, the thrown player lands in an occupied square:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The player occupying the square is Knocked Down (an Armour roll and possible Injury roll is made against them even if they were already Prone or Stunned). If the player occupying the square is a team-mate then a Turnover will be caused.</li>
        <li>The thrown player will bounce (as if they were the ball) from the square they land in and will automatically be Knocked Down upon landing; however, unlike normally when a player is Knocked Down during their own team turn, this will not cause a Turnover unless the thrown player was holding the ball.</li>
        <li>Should the thrown player bounce into another occupied square, the above process is repeated.</li>
    </ul>
</ins>
<h5>Crash Landing</h5>
<p>If the thrown player was Prone or Stunned, or had lost their Tackle Zone before they were thrown, they cannot attempt to land safely:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Once the scatter has been resolved, the player will bounce (as if they were a ball) from the square they land in.</li>
    <li>The player will automatically Fall Over after bouncing and an Armour roll and possible Injury roll is made against them.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Landing in the Crowd</h5>
<p>Should the thrown player scatter off the pitch, they will land in the crowd. The player is immediately removed from play and placed in their team dugout. Landing in the crowd is very dangerous as Blood Bowl fans are notoriously violent, so the player risks 'Injury by the Crowd', as described on <a href="#p61">page 61</a>. This will determine if the player is placed in the Reserves, Knocked-out or Casualty box.</p>
<p>If a player in possession of the ball lands in the crowd after being thrown, a Turnover is caused and the ball will be thrown-in by the crowd as described on <a href="#p51">page 51</a>.</p>

                <h3>Blocking</h3>
<p>At its most basic, a block is a very rough tackle. The rules of Blood Bowl allow players to do almost anything to bring down an opponent, and provided weapons aren't used, the officials rarely make any distinction between a skilled tackle and a frenzied rain of pummelling blows that leave a player unconscious. This is part of the game's charm. After all, who wouldn't want to watch a violent, full contact bloodsport that happens to include some ball related drama!</p>
<h4>Block Actions</h4>
<p>When a Standing player is activated, they can immediately nominate a single Standing opposition player that they are currently Marking and declare that they will target them with a Block action. Unlike other actions, there is no limit to how many players may perform a Block action each team turn.</p>
<p>A player performing a Block action cannot move before or after, and Prone players cannot stand up and perform a Block action. However, if the target of the Block action is 'pushed back' into another square, the player that made the action may 'follow-up' into the square vacated, carried forward by the momentum of the attack.</p>
<p>Once per team turn, a single player on the active team may perform a Blitz action. A Blitz action combines a Block action with a Move action. A Blitz action may be performed by a Prone player.</p>
<p>Block actions are resolved using special block dice, unique to Blood Bowl. How many block dice are rolled and which coach chooses the result to apply is determined by the Strength of the player performing the Block action compared with the Strength of the player that is the target of the Block action.</p>
<h5>Strength</h5>
<p>Once an active player has declared they will perform a Block action and nominated their target, the next thing to do is to compare the Strength characteristic of both players, including any Strength modifiers granted by Skills or Traits or offered by 'assists' from team-mates (see opposite). If one player is stronger than the other, they are more likely to knock their opponent down:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If both players have the same Strength characteristic, after modification, one block dice is rolled.</li>
    <li>If one player has a higher Strength characteristic, after modification, a pool of two block dice is rolled and the coach of the stronger player selects which result to apply.</li>
    <li>If one player has a Strength characteristic that is more than double that of their opponent, after modification, a pool of three block dice is rolled and the coach of the stronger player selects which result to apply.</li>
</ul>
                                
            </div>
                    <div id="p57" class="page">
                <a href="#p57" class="page-number">#57</a>
                <h5>Assisting a Block</h5>
<p>The Strength characteristic of the player that is performing the Block action, or of the player that is the target of the Block action, can be modified by assists offered by team-mates that are in a position to help. In this way, two or more players can gang up on another. There are two types of assist that can be counted: 'offensive' and 'defensive'.</p>
<h6>Offensive Assists</h6>
<p>An offensive assist is when another player on the active team, a team-mate of the player that is performing the Block action, is able to assist. To offer an offensive assist, a player must be Marking the opposition player that is the target of their team-mate's Block action.</p>
<p>A player cannot offer an offensive assist if they are being Marked by any opposition player other than the one that is the target of their team-mate's Block action.</p>
<p>Each offensive assist counted modifies the Strength characteristic of the player performing the Block action by +1.</p>
<h6>Defensive Assists</h6>
<p>A defensive assist is when another player on the inactive team, a team-mate of the player that is the target of a Block action, is able to assist. To offer a defensive assist, a player must be Marking the opposition player that is performing the Block action against their team-mate.</p>
<p>A player cannot offer a defensive assist if they are being Marked by any opposition player other than the one that is performing the Block action against their team-mate.</p>
<p>Each defensive assist counted modifies the Strength characteristic of the player that is the target of the Block action by +1.</p>
<h5>Block Dice</h5>
<p>Once offensive and defensive assists have been worked out and the number of block dice to be rolled determined, roll the block dice. Block dice feature five icons, each representing an outcome. Some of these outcomes can be modified by Skills or Traits possessed by one or both players:</p>
<h6>Player Down</h6>
<p>Something has gone terribly wrong and the player performing the Block action has come off the worst. The active player is immediately Knocked Down by the player they were attempting to block!</p>
<h6>Both Down</h6>
<p>Neither player comes off particularly well. Both the active player and the target of the Block action are Knocked Down by one another.</p>
<p>If one of the players has the Block skill (as described on <a href="#p76">page 76</a>), they may choose to ignore this result and not be Knocked Down. If both players have the Block skill, they may both ignore this result, in which case both players bash heads in a clatter of armour, but nothing else really happens!</p>
<h6>Push Back</h6>
<p>The active player gives their opponent an almighty shove, forcing them backwards. The target of the Block action is pushed back one square by the active player. The active player may follow-up into the square vacated. Pushing other players is covered in more detail on <a href="#p58">page 58</a>.</p>
<h6>Stumble</h6>
<p>The target of the Block action attempts to avoid their aggressor. If the target of the Block action has the Dodge skill and chooses to use it (as described on <a href="#p75">page 75</a>), they are able to avoid being hit and this result becomes a Push Back, as described above. Otherwise, this result becomes a POW!, as described below. In either case, the active player may follow-up into the square vacated.</p>
<h6>Pow!</h6>
<p>The block is tremendously effective and the target keels over to land flat on their back! The target of the Block action is pushed back by the active player and is then Knocked Down in the square they have been moved into. The active player may follow up into the square vacated.</p>

                <h5>Select and Apply Result</h5>
<p>Regardless of the Strength of the players involved, it is always the coach of the player performing the Block action that will roll the block dice. If a pool of two or more block dice is being rolled, it is always the coach of the player with the higher Strength that will select which result is applied against the target.</p>
<p>Note that when both players have the same Strength characteristic, only one block dice is rolled, so there is only one result available!</p>
<h5>Pushed Players</h5>
<p>The Push Back and POW! block dice results call for the target of a Block action to be 'pushed back'. A pushed back player is involuntarily moved one square away from the player performing the action. The pushed back player is moved into a square chosen by the coach of the player performing the action. The squares a pushed back player can be moved into will depend upon the direction from which the block came, as shown in the diagrams below:</p>
<p>The square the pushed back player is moved into must be an unoccupied square. If this is not possible, the pushed back player will either be pushed into the crowd (see opposite) or a chain-push will occur (see opposite). Note that only players can occupy a square, if a square contains only the ball or a trapdoor, it is unoccupied and a pushed back player may be moved into it. If a pushed back player is moved into a square that contains the ball, the ball will bounce. A player cannot attempt to pick up the ball when pushed back.</p>

<p>
    <img src="./images/pushed-players-2.jpg" width="315" height="176">
</p>

<h6>Chained Pushes</h6>
<p>If there are no unoccupied squares to move a pushed back player into, the player is moved into a square occupied by another player, causing a 'chain-push'. When a player is chain-pushed, they are pushed back themselves exactly as described above. The chain-pushed player is moved into a square chosen by the coach of the player performing the Block action. The squares a chain-pushed player can be moved into will depend upon the direction from which the push came, as shown in the diagrams previously.</p>
<p>A player can be chain-pushed even if they are Prone or Stunned. A chain-push can cause a player from either team to be moved and may result in a player being pushed into the crowd.</p>
<p>
    <img src="./images/chain-pushes.jpg" width="316" height="284">
</p>
<h6>Pushed into the crowd</h6>
<p>If a player occupies a square adjacent to a sideline or within an End Zone when pushed back, and if the only square they can be pushed into is occupied, or if there are no squares they can be pushed into, the player will be 'pushed into the crowd'.</p>
<p>A player that is pushed into the crowd is immediately removed from play and placed in their team dugout. A player pushed into the crowd risks 'Injury by the Crowd', as described on <a href="#p61">page 61</a>. This will determine if the player is placed in the Reserves, Knocked-out or Casualty box.</p>
<p>If a player in possession of the ball is pushed into the crowd, the ball will be thrown-in by the crowd as described on <a href="#p51">page 51</a>. Additionally, if a player on the active team that is in possession of the ball is pushed into the crowd, a Turnover is caused.</p>

                                
            </div>
                    <div id="p59" class="page">
                <a href="#p59" class="page-number">#59</a>
                <h5>Knocked Down</h5>
<p>Several block dice results cause one (or both!) players to be Knocked Down, as described on <a href="#p27">page 27</a>. This can lead to a Turnover, as described on <a href="#p23">page 23</a>, if a player is Knocked Down when they are the one performing the Block action! If a player is pushed back and Knocked Down, the push back happens first and the player is Knocked Down in the square they have been moved into.</p>
<h5>Placed Prone</h5>
<p>Some Skills may allow a player that is Knocked Down during a Block action to instead be Placed Prone. Where this is the case, the rules above are unchanged, it is simply the outcome that is altered as no Armour roll is made against a player that is Placed Prone and they do not risk injury.</p>
<h4>Follow-Up</h4>
<p>When an active player making a Block action pushes the target back they may 'follow-up', moving directly into the square vacated by the pushed back player. You must decide if your player will follow-up before any further dice rolls are made. When a player follows-up, it is a free move; they do not need to Rush, they do not need to Dodge, and they do not count as having used any of their Movement Allowance.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a player must follow-up due to an in-game effect, a special rule, or a Skill or Trait, whether they want to or not. At other times, a player may be prevented from following-up even if they want to, perhaps due to a Skill the target of the Block action possesses for example. In such cases, rules that prevent a player from following-up always take precedence.</p>
<p>Note that when a player follows-up, they are always considered to have moved voluntarily. This is the case even when a player must follow-up due to an in-game effect, a special rule, or a Skill or Trait, whether they want to or not.</p>
<h4>Blitz Actions</h4>
<p>Usually, when a player performs a Block action, it is performed on its own. But, once per team turn as mentioned on <a href="#p43">page 43</a>, a single Standing or Prone player on the active team may be activated to perform a Blitz action; an action that allows the player to combine a Move action and a Block action. When a player Blitzes, they may move as normal. In addition, they may perform a Block action (or a Special action granted by a Skill or Trait that can be performed instead of a Block action), the target of which must be nominated when the player is activated, before they have moved.</p>
<p>Movement during a Blitz action follows all of the normal rules for moving as described on <a href="#p44">page 44</a>. The Block action (or a Special action) can be made before, after or even during the Blitz move, meaning that the player can move part of their Movement Allowance, perform a Block action (or a Special action), and then continue to move should they wish and if they are able to do so.</p>
<p>Performing the Block action (or a Special action granted by a Skill or Trait that can be performed instead of a Block action) costs one square of the player's Movement Allowance. However, depending upon the outcome of the Block action, the player may follow up as described above, effectively regaining this lost square of Movement Allowance.</p>
<p>During their movement, a player performing a Blitz action may attempt to gain extra squares of Movement Allowance by Rushing, as described on <a href="#p44">page 44</a>. If after moving the player does not have sufficient Movement Allowance remaining to perform the Block action (or a Special action granted by a Skill or Trait that can be performed instead of a Block action), they may Rush to gain the square of Movement Allowance required. If they cannot Rush, they cannot perform the Block action (or a Special action).</p>

                <h3>Armour and Injuries</h3>
<p>There are many ways in which a Blood Bowl player can get injured. From being gored by a rampaging Minotaur, to tripping and breaking an ankle whilst Rushing, Blood Bowl is a game that provides almost limitless opportunity to get seriously hurt! Even death is an ever-present threat! Most Blood Bowl players proudly sport impressive scars, and it is widely said that an old pro can be easily identified by the way they wince and grumble about their aches and pains during wet weather.</p>
<h4>Risking Injury</h4>
<p>As described on <a href="#p27">page 27</a>, whenever one player is Knocked Down by another, be it as the result of a Block action or some other, more devious trick, they become Prone and risk injury. Likewise, whenever a player Falls Over, most often caused by failing an Agility test when dodging, or tripping as they Rush across the pitch, they become Prone and risk injury. When a player is Knocked Down or Falls Over, the coach of the opposing team will make an Armour roll against that player.</p>
<p>Note that when a player is Placed Prone, perhaps having wrestled an opponent to the ground, there is no risk of injury and no Armour roll is made against them.</p>
<h5>Amour Rolls</h5>
<p>An Armour roll is made as described on <a href="#p29">page 29</a>, by the coach of the opposing team. If the player's armour is 'broken', an Injury roll is made. If their armour is not broken, it protects them from harm.</p>
<h5>Injury Rolls</h5>
<p>Whenever a player's armour is broken, an Injury roll is made against them. The coach of the opposing team rolls 2D6 and consults the table below:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper">
    <table>
        <caption>Injury Table</caption>

        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<h5>Stunty Players</h5>
<p>Players with the Stunty trait (see <a href="#p86">page 86</a>) are particularly small and fragile, meaning they are more prone to breaking when hit! If an Injury roll is ever made against a player with the Stunty trait, roll on this table instead:</p>

                <h5>Injured by the Crowd</h5>
<p>When a player is pushed back into the crowd or lands in the crowd there is no telling how the fans will treat them, and they risk Injury by the Crowd. No Armour roll is made against the player. Instead the coach of the opposing team immediately rolls on the Injury table to see what the crowd does to the player:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the player is Stunned, they are placed in the Reserves box.</li>
    <li>If the player is Knocked-out, they are placed in the Knocked-out box. They may recover as usual at the end of the drive.</li>
    <li>If the player becomes a casualty, they are placed in the Casualty box. A roll is made again</li>
</ul>
<h5>Casualty Rolls</h5>
<p>Whenever a player becomes a casualty, a Casualty roll is made against them. The coach of the opposing team rolls a D16 and consults the table below:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper">

</div>
<h6>MNG (Miss Next Game)</h6>
<p>The player misses the rest of this game, but will need more time to recuperate. In league play, the player is not available to play in the team's next game. Make a note of this on the Team Draft list. The team's CTV is reduced by this player's current value until the end of the post-game sequence of the team's next game (see <a href="#p69">page 69</a>). If this player's absence leaves the team with fewer than 11 players, they are replaced by a Journeyman player ahead of the next game, as described on <a href="#p38">page 38</a>.</p>
<h6>NI (Nigling Injury)</h6>
<p>Make a note on the Team Draft list that this player has picked up a Niggling Injury. There is a +1 modifier applied to all future rolls made against this player on the Casualty table per Niggling Injury they have.</p>
<h6>Characteristic Reduction</h6>
<p>The player has one of their characteristics reduced by 1. To determine which, roll a D6 on the table below.</p>

    <p>In the case of Movement Allowance or Strength, the characteristic is simply reduced by 1. In the case of Agility, Passing Ability or Armour Value, the target number is raised by 1. For example, if a player with AG4+ suffers a Neck Injury, the characteristic would become AG5+.</p>

                <h4>Substitutions</h4>
<p>Substitute players may not be brought on during a drive. The only time fresh players can be brought on from the Reserves box to replace those removed from play through injury (or Sent-off!) is whilst setting up for a new drive, prior to restarting the game (see <a href="#p67">page 67</a>).</p>
<h4>Apothecaries</h4>
<p>Once per game, a team with an apothecary may use them to 'patch-up' any permanently hired players belonging to it that have been removed from play after being Knocked-out or after having a Casualty roll made against them. An apothecary cannot be used to patch-up any Journeymen players or any Induced players, such as Mercenaries or Star Players. Journeymen are rarely considered worth the effort, whilst Mercenaries and Star Players travel with their own staff of healers and medics.</p>
<h5>Patching-Up Knocked-Out Players</h5>
<p>Once per game, an apothecary can be used immediately when a player becomes Knocked-out:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the player was on the pitch when they were Knocked-out, they are not removed from play. Instead, they remain on the pitch and become Stunned.</li>
    <li>If the player was Knocked-out as a result of being pushed back into the crowd or landing in the crowd, place them directly into the Reserves box rather than the Knocked-out box.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Patching-Up Casualties</h5>
<p>Alternatively, once per game an apothecary can be used when a Casualty roll is made against a player:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Immediately after the Casualty roll is made against your player, you may declare the use of an apothecary.</li>
    <li>The coach of the opposing team rolls again on the Casualty table, giving two possible outcomes. You may choose which result is applied to your player.</li>
    <li>If a Badly Hurt result is applied, the apothecary has been able to patch the player up and pump them full of painkillers. The player is removed from the Casualty box and placed in the Reserves box.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the use of an apothecary comes before any other attempts to heal the player. This includes the use of any Skills or Traits, or any other in-game effect or special rule that may modify the Casualty roll or its effect.</p>

                <h3>Kicking them while they're down</h3>
<p>Fouling is strictly against the rules of Blood Bowl, and any player tempted to stick the boot in risks the wrath of the referees. Not that this stops anyone of course! Many teams are renowned for being dirty and devious, and more than a few players have built a career upon the art of the foul. Indeed, fouling is now such an established part of the game that the RARG has established guidelines allowing members to turn a blind eye.</p>
<h4>Foul Actions</h4>
<p>As mentioned previously, once per team turn, a single player on the active team may commit a Foul action. When activated, the player nominates a single Prone or Stunned player on the opposing team to be the victim of the Foul. The player may move before committing the Foul, following all of the normal movement rules, but must be in a square adjacent to the player they wish to Foul when the action is made. Once the Foul has been committed, they may not move further and their activation comes to an end.</p>
<h5>Fouling</h5>
<p>To commit a Foul, simply make an Armour roll (and possible Injury roll) against the nominated victim. Offensive and defensive assists are worked out before this Armour roll is made, exactly as when performing a Block action, as described on <a href="#p57">page 57</a>. Rather than modifying Strength, these assists will modify the Armour roll:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Apply a +1 modifier to the Armour roll for each offensive assist.</li>
    <li>Apply a -1 modifier to the Armour roll for each defensive assist.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Being Sent-Off</h5>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, if a natural double is rolled (i.e., if two 2s are rolled before applying any modifiers) when making either the Armour roll or an Injury roll against the victim of the Foul action, the referee has seen a player committing a foul right in front of them and that cannot be ignored. The player committing the Foul action is Sent-off. They are immediately removed from play and must miss the rest of the game. When a player is Sent-off, a Turnover is caused.</p>
<h5>Arguing the Call</h5>
<p>When a player is Sent-off by the referee for committing a Foul, their coach may attempt to Argue the Call. Roll a D6 and refer to the table below:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper">
    <table>
        <caption>Argue the call</caption>
        <thead>
        <tr>

            <th scope="row">1</th>
            <td>
                <strong>“You're Outta Here!”</strong> The referee is so enraged that the coach is ejected along with the player. For the remainder of this game, you may no longer Argue the Call and must apply a -1 modifier when rolling for Brilliant Coaching.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">2-5</th>
            <td>
                <strong>“I Don't Care!”</strong> The referee is not interested in your argument. The player is Sent-off and a Turnover caused.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">6</th>
            <td>
                <strong>“Well, When You Put It Like That…”</strong> The referee is swayed by your argument. A Turnover is still caused, but the player that committed the Foul is not Sent-off.

                <h3>Touchdown!</h3>
<p>The game of Blood Bowl is won by scoring touchdowns. If one team can score more than the other team, they will win. True, there are many, many teams that consider scoring touchdowns secondary to committing acts of violence, but even the most bloodthirsty of teams will start scoring some touchdowns once the opposition has been satisfactorily dealt with. Proof indeed that the basic premise of the game is so simple that even an Orc can understand it!</p>
<h4>Scoring a Touchdown</h4>
<p>A touchdown can be scored by any player, even players that are not currently active themselves or that belong to the inactive team. A touchdown is scored when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Standing player in possession of the ball enters a square that is within the opposing team's End Zone without Falling Over or being Knocked Down.</li>
    <li>A Standing player picks up or catches the ball whilst occupying a square within the opposing team's End Zone.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a player that occupies a square within the opposing team's End Zone who catches the ball will immediately score a touchdown. Alternatively, a player in possession of the ball may be chain-pushed into the opposing team's End Zone.</p>
<p>Note, however, that if a player is Placed Prone, Falls Over or is Knocked Down whilst moving into the opposition's End Zone, no touchdown is scored. A player must be Standing for a touchdown to be scored.</p>
<p>As soon as a touchdown is scored, play stops (effectively causing a Turnover, as described on <a href="#p23">page 23</a>, but a Turnover you can be pleased with!).</p>
<h5>Scoring During Your Opponent's Turn</h5>
<p>In some rare cases a player will find themselves able to score a touchdown during the opposing team's turn. For example, a player holding the ball could be pushed back into the End Zone but not Knocked Down by a Block action made against them.</p>
<p>If one of your players that is in possession of the ball is moved for any reason so that they occupy a square within the opposing team's End Zone, and if that player remains Standing after they have been moved, at any point during the opposing team's turn, your opponent's team turn ends immediately and your team becomes active. However, rather than playing a full turn, your team turn will end as soon as it begins with a touchdown being scored.</p>
<h5>Record Score</h5>
<p>Arguably the most important thing to remember when a touchdown is scored is to record the score! This is done by the coach of the team that scored, by moving their score marker one place along the Score tracker of their team's dugout. Singing, dancing and other celebrations are encouraged.</p>
<h5>Stalling</h5>
<p>Sometimes, a coach will want their team to run the clock down, opting not to score when they easily could. At other times a team can get so caught up in the violence of the game that they simply forget to score when they have the chance. This is a perfectly valid tactic, although in some instances it can be risky!</p>
<p>If at any point during your team turn a player belonging to your team meets all of the following criteria, that player is said to be 'Stalling':</p>
<ol>
    <li>If the player is Open.</li>
    <li>If the player is in possession of the ball.</li>
    <li>If the player is able to activate and perform their declared action without the need to first roll a D6.</li>

    <li>
        <del class="errata">If the player is able to move into the opposition's End Zone without needing to Rush or Dodge.</del>
        <ins class="errata">If the player is able to move into the opposition’s End Zone without needing to roll any dice. This includes, but is not limited to, the player having to Dodge, Leap, Rush, Jump over a Prone player or Blitz.</ins>
    </li>
</ol>
<p> Failing to activate a Stalling player before your turn ends (even if it ends unexpectedly with a Turnover), or activating that player but declining to score a touchdown, is Stalling.</p>

                <h3>The End of a Drive</h3>
<p>When a drive comes to an end, either as the result of a touchdown being scored, or when time runs out for the half and the referee blows their whistle, play will halt. Unless the full-time whistle has been blown, there will be another drive to come, and both teams will make use of the lull in activity. This gives both teams time to make substitutions, talk tactics, and for cheerleaders and sideline performers to entertain the crowds and enthuse their supporters.</p>
<h4>End of Drive Sequence</h4>
<p>When a touchdown is scored or at the end of the final turn of a half, the current drive comes to an end and play will halt. If there are more turns of the current half or a full half still to come, play only halts temporarily. Both coaches run through the following sequence of steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>DEAL WITH SECRET WEAPONS:</strong> Any Secret Weapon players risk being Sent-off.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>RECOVER KNOCKED-OUT PLAYERS:</strong> Knocked-out players may recover.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>THE DRIVE ENDS:</strong> The drive ends.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>1. Deal with Secret Weapons</h4>
<p>If either team fielded any players with the Secret Weapon trait during the preceding drive, those players will be Sent-off for committing a Foul, even if they were not on the pitch at the end of the drive. When a player is Sent-off in this way, their coach may attempt to Argue the Call as described on <a href="#p63">page 63</a>. A single Bribe Inducement may also be used per player Sent-off in this way, if any are available and should the coach wish (see <a href="#p91">page 91</a>). If either is successful, the player is not Sent-off.</p>
<h4>2. Recover Knocked-out Players</h4>
<p>If either coach has any players in the Knocked-out box of their dugout, they may now see if they have recovered enough to take part in the next drive. Roll a D6 for each player that is currently Knocked-out:</p>
<ul>
    <li>On a roll of 4+, the player has recovered and is raring to go. Recovered players are immediately placed in the Reserves box of their team dugout.</li>
    <li>On a roll of 1-3, the player is still far too insensible to take to the pitch again.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. The Drive Ends</h4>
<p>The drive comes to an end. Any special rules or effects, from any source, that lasted for the duration of this drive will expire now.</p>

                <h4>Restarting the Game</h4>
<p>If there are still turns to be played in the current half, or if there is another full half still to play, both teams will set up again, as described on <a href="#p40">page 40</a>. If the previous drive ended with a touchdown, the team that scored the touchdown now becomes the defence and will kick-off to the team that conceded the touchdown.</p>
<h4>Ending the Game</h4>
<p>At the end of the second half, the game will end. Unless the game is a league fixture, there is nothing else to do but determine the winner. In a league, however, the post-game sequence is when coaches work out winnings, players may gain advancements, and so on (see <a href="#p69">page 69</a>).</p>
<h5>Winning the Game</h5>
<p>The team that has scored the most touchdowns at the end of the game is declared the winner. If there is no clear winner, a period of extra time may be played, as described opposite.</p>
<h5>Conceding</h5>
<p>It is very rare for a Blood Bowl team to concede a game, most would sooner play to the death than quit the pitch in shame. But sometimes a coach may put discretion before valour and say they've had enough. You may concede at the start of any of your team turns. However, doing so means that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The opposition is awarded one touchdown, and any touchdowns your team has scored are voided and awarded to the opposition.</li>
    <li>You are unable to award an MVP to any of your players.</li>
    <li>You do not generate any winnings.</li>
    <li>Your Dedicated Fans characteristic is reduced by D3 (to a minimum of 1).</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, roll a D6 for each of your players that has gained three or more advancements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>On a roll of 1-3, the player quits the team in disgust. Immediately delete the player from your Team Draft list.</li>
    <li>On a roll of 4+, the player remains with the team.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Extra Time</h4>
<p>Sometimes, an important fixture needs a clear winner. League semi-finals, finals and tournament grand finals are both prime examples, but during exhibition play as well, having a clear winner can often be vital!</p>
<p>If, at the end of the second half, the score is tied between both teams, an eight turn period of extra time can be played. Once the End of Drive sequence is resolved, extra time begins by determining which team will kick and which will receive, as described on <a href="#p38">page 38</a>.</p>
<p>Team re-rolls are not replenished at the start of extra time. However, any team re-rolls that were not used during the second half are carried over into extra time. In all other respects, extra time is played exactly like a normal half.</p>
<h5>Sudden Death</h5>
<p>If there is still no clear winner at the end of extra time, the game is decided by a penalty roll-off, representing the teams taking part in a field goal penalty shoot-out (the only time field goals are used in modern Blood Bowl). To resolve sudden death, both coaches roll-off five times, each rolling a D6 and re-rolling ties. The coach who wins the most roll-offs wins the game.</p>

                <h2>Post Game Sequence</h2>
<p>Over the course of a league, Blood Bowl teams will grow and evolve with every game played; some rookie players will learn new skills and develop as players, others will suffer injuries that may threaten their career, and some will even die! Whilst fatalities are not unexpected in a violent bloodsport, they can be a trifle annoying for any coach, particularly if the deceased player was beginning to show promise or, even worse, if they were a valued and talented veteran of the gridiron. Fortunately, the sorrow of loss can be eased by counting the winnings, allowing new players to be recruited, providing fresh blood for an under strength team, and existing players can be trained and developed into the stars of the future!</p>

                <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
<p>Once the final whistle has blown on a game played during a league and the exuberant crowds have left the stadium, both coaches will run their teams through the post-game sequence. This is when winnings are counted and spent on new players and Sideline Staff, when casualties are assessed and either treated or dismissed, and when players and their various skills evaluated and, invariably, team tactics are reviewed.</p>
<h4>League and Exhibition Play</h4>
<p>After a league fixture, both coaches should run through the full post-game sequence step by step. In exhibition play, the post-game sequence need not be completed.</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Record Outcome and Winnings:</strong> The details of the game, its outcome and each team's winnings are recorded on the Game Record sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Update Dedicated Fans:</strong> Record any changes to Dedicated Fans based on the outcome of the game.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Player Achievement:</strong> Any players that have earned enough SPP may spend them on advancements.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hiring, Firing and Temporarily Retiring:</strong> New players and staff are recruited. Injured players may be dismissed or may temporarily retire. Any unwanted staff may be dismissed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Expensive Mistakes:</strong> If the team has sufficient wealth left unspent, there is a chance players and staff will spend it irresponsibly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Prepare For Next Fixture:</strong> Team Value and Current Team Value are both updated ready for the next league fixture.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>1. Record Outcome and Winnings</h4>
<p>At the end of each and every league fixture, both coaches are responsible for correctly recording on their Game Record sheet the details of how their team performed and the outcome of the match. Each coach should record the following information in the appropriate sections of their Game Record sheet so that it can be passed on to the league commissioner:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The result of the game (win, lose or draw).</li>
    <li>How many touchdowns were scored (by each team).</li>
    <li>How many Casualties were caused (counting only those that generate SPP, as described in Step 3).</li>
    <li>How many League points were earned (see <a href="#p98">page 98</a>).</li>
    <li>Finally, any players that suffered a DEAD result on the Casualty table during this game are deleted from your Team Draft list (see <a href="#p60">page 60</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Winnings</h5>
<p>At the end of every game, each team receives a fee for playing, usually paid by the stadium owner from ticket sales. To work out how much each team wins:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Divide the Fan Attendance for the game (see below) by two.</li>
    <li>Add the number of touchdowns your team scored to this figure.</li>
    <li>Multiply the total by 10,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is how many gold pieces your team has won for this game. This is recorded in the 'Winnings' section of the Game Record sheet and is added immediately to the team's Treasury.</p>
<p>Note that, if one team conceded, Fan Attendance is not divided by two. Instead, the full amount is awarded to the winning team.</p>
<h5>Fan Attendance</h5>
<p>This is worked out by simply adding together the Fan Factor of both teams to determine the total number of fans present.</p>
<h4>2. Update Dedicated Fans</h4> A good result can see a team's fan following increase, and a prolonged winning streak can bring the fans flocking to buy tickets and merchandise. This sort of popularity can really help a team financially:
<ul>
    <li>If your team won the game, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than your current Dedicated Fans characteristic, increase your Dedicated Fans characteristic by 1.</li>
    <li>If your team lost the game, roll a D6. If the result is lower than your current Dedicated Fans characteristic, reduce your Dedicated Fans characteristic by 1.</li>
    <li>If the game was a draw, neither team's Dedicated Fans characteristic will increase or decrease.</li>
</ul>
                                
            </div>
                    <div id="p70" class="page">
                <a href="#p70" class="page-number">#70</a>
                <h4>3. Player Advancement</h4>
<p>During a league, players on your team will develop by earning Star Player Points (SPP) during the games they participate in. Should a player earn enough Star Player Points, they gain an advancement. Players who survive long enough will progress to become Legendary Players, with special characteristics and skills that they have picked up over the course of their career on the Blood Bowl pitch.</p>
<h5>Recording Star Player Points</h5>
<p>The Team Draft list includes boxes in which to keep a tally of each player's achievements during a game. Each time a player does something to earn SPPs you should record it. At the end of the game, count up the tallies and record that player's total number of SPP.</p>
<p>Note that Star Players and/or Mercenaries purchased as Inducements at the start of the game do not earn SPP. Journeymen, however, do, and you should record any SPP a Journeyman earns during a game as you will have the opportunity to permanently hire that player in Step 4.</p>
<h5>Earning Star Player Points</h5>
<p>Be it for scoring touchdowns or for earning Most Valuable Player awards, the full list of achievements that generate SPP is as follows:</p>
<h6>Completion (COMP)</h6>
<p>Often when a player passes the ball or throws a team-mate, something can go wrong. When it goes right, however, it is called a Completion, and the fans love it!</p>
<ul>
    <li>Passing Completions: When a player makes an accurate Pass action which is caught by a team-mate occupying the target square, they are said to have made a 'Passing Completion'. A Passing Completion earns the player 1 SPP.</li>
    <li>Throwing Completions: When a player makes a superb Throw Team-Mate action, and if the thrown player lands safely, they are said to have made a 'Throwing Completion'. A Throwing Completion earns the player 1 SPP.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Passing Interference</h6>
<p>When a player successfully interferes with a Pass action, the effect can be dramatic indeed! A Simple Deflection can have a huge impact upon a game, whilst an Interception can completely reverse the flow of play!</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Deflections:</strong> A Deflection earns the player 1 SPP.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Interceptions:</strong> An Interception earns the player 2 SPP.
    </li>
</ul>
<h6>Casualty (CAS)</h6>
<p>If an opposition player is Knocked Down as the result of a Block action and removed from play as a Casualty, regardless of which player performed the action, your player is said to have caused a 'Casualty'. Causing a Casualty earns the player 2 SPP.</p>
<p>Note that Star Player Points for causing a Casualty are earned even if both players were Knocked Down and removed from play. Note also that Casualty rolls caused by the crowd or by any other type of action do not earn Star Player Points.</p>
<h6>Touchdown (TD)</h6>
<p>When a player scores a touchdown, they earn 3 SPP. If your team was awarded any touchdowns as a result of the opposition conceding the game, as described on <a href="#p67">page 67</a>, you may allocate each touchdown to a player of your choice and give them SPP accordingly.</p>
<h6>Most Valuable Player (MVP)</h6>
<p>At the end of the game, each coach randomly selects one player from their team (not including Star Players and/ or Mercenaries) that was eligible to play during this game and that did not suffer a Casualty result of 15-16, DEAD. That player receives the Most Valuable Player award, earning 4 SPP.</p>

                <h5>Spending Star Player Points</h5>
<p>If, once the MVP is determined and each player's tally of SPP has been counted up, a player has sufficient SPP, they can spend them to gain an advancement. The SPP cost of each advancement is shown on the table below. The more experienced a player is, the more SPP each new advancement they gain will cost. A player is not obliged to spend their SPP until they have enough to randomly select a characteristic improvement, at which point they must spend some or all of their SPP:</p>

</div>
<h5>New Skills</h5>
<p>Each team roster shows the Skill categories available to each player. Players have 'Primary' access to some Skill categories, and 'Secondary' access to others. Players can gain Skills from their Primary skill categories easily, whilst gaining Skills from their Secondary skill categories is more costly in terms of SPP.</p>
<p>Choosing a Skill is simple: select a Skill category available to the player and choose a Skill from that category that the player does not already have, then reduce the player's SPP by the amount shown on the Advancements table. Finally, record the player's new Skill on your Team Draft list.</p>
<p>When a player gains a random Skill, choose the Skill category you wish to generate the Skill from and roll two D6, one after the other, on the Skill table on <a href="#p74">page 74</a> (re-rolling if the player already has that Skill or if they roll a Skill they cannot have) and reduce the player's SPP by the amount shown on the Advancements table. Finally, record the player's new Skill on your Team Draft list.</p>
<p>Note that, without exception, no player may be given as a new Skill a Skill that they already have. For example, you may not give a player with the Mighty Blow (+X) skill the same Skill again in an attempt to improve the effect of the Skill.</p>
<h5>Characteristic Improvements</h5>
<p>Rather than spend SPP on a new Skill, a player may spend SPP to improve a characteristic. To do so, simply reduce the player's SPP by the amount shown on the Advancements table, roll D16 on the table below and record the player's improved characteristic on your Team Draft list:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper">
    <table>
        <caption>Characteristic Improvement Table</caption>
        <thead>
        <tr>

            <th scope="col">Result</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">1-7</th>
            <td>Improve either MA or AV by 1 (or choose a Secondary skill).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">8-13</th>
            <td>Improve either MA, PA or AV by 1 (or choose a Secondary skill).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">14</th>
            <td>Improve either AG or PA by 1 (or choose a Secondary skill).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">15</th>
            <td>Improve either ST or AG by 1 (or choose a Secondary skill).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">16</th>
            <td>Improve a characteristic of your choice by 1.</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>Note that no characteristic can ever be improved more than twice, or above the maximum value shown on <a href="#p28">page 28</a>. Should you randomly select a characteristic that cannot be improved or that you do not wish to improve, the player may instead choose a Secondary skill.</p>
<p>In the case of Movement Allowance, Strength or Armour Value, this means the characteristic is increased by 1. In the case of Agility or Passing Ability, however, the characteristic is lowered by 1. For example, if a player with AG4+ improves their Agility, the characteristic would become AG3+.</p>

                <h5>Value Increase</h5>
<p>As players gain advancements, their value increases. To reflect this, whenever a player spends SPP to gain an advancement, their Current Value must be increased on the Team Draft list, as described on <a href="#p30">page 30</a>, by the amount shown on the table below:</p>

<h4>4. Hiring, Firing and Temporarily Retiring</h4>
<p>Players are prone to injury, and even the biggest superstars can find themselves looking for work elsewhere if their injuries outweigh their abilities. After all, there are always fresh-faced rookies looking to make a name for themselves for a fraction of the cost! Similarly, coaches will often hire and fire Sideline Staff on a regular basis to manage their overheads. During this step of the post-game sequence a team may:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Spend any amount of gold from the Treasury to buy new players from your team roster and/or Sideline Staff and increase Team Value accordingly.</li>
    <li>Fire any players and/or Sideline Staff who are no longer required, deleting them from the Team Draft list and reducing Team Value accordingly.</li>
    <li>Purchase additional team re-rolls, but must pay double to do so, as described on <a href="#p34">page 34</a>.</li>
    <li>Permanently hire any Journeymen that played for the team during this game:
        <ul>
            <li> A team must have fewer than 16 players on its Team Draft list to permanently hire Journeymen.</li>
            <li> If permanently hired, a Journeyman loses the Loner (X+) trait but retains any SPP earned during this game or advancements gained during Step 3.</li>
            <li> If not permanently hired, Journeymen will leave and not return. Any SPP earned or advancements gained are lost.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Temporarily Retiring</h5>
<p>During the post-game sequence of a game in which a player suffers a Lasting Injury result on the Casualty table, that player may be given time off to recover. Taking some time off may allow them to return fit and healthy for next season should you wish to re-draft your team (see <a href="#p100">page 100</a>).</p>
<p>When a player Temporarily Retires (TR), make a note in the appropriate box on your Team Draft List. They remain as part of your team and are not deleted from your Team Draft List. They cannot take part in any further games this season but they will still count towards both the maximum number of players of their type allowed by the team roster, and the 16 player maximum. Finally, whilst their Current Value is counted when working out Team Value, it is not counted when working out Current Team Value.</p>

                <h4>5. Expensive Mistakes</h4>
<p>As any Blood Bowl coach knows, there's nothing more risky than a large sum of gold in the team treasury. Whenever a team has money to burn, someone will come along with a tinderbox! Whether the tabloids need paying off to avoid a scandal, a local innkeeper demands compensation for damages or an errant cheerleader bets the treasury on a squig fight, most coaches agree that it's not worth holding onto big sums of cash. If you have 100,000 gold pieces or more stored in your Treasury during this step of the post-game sequence, roll a D6 on the following table, applying the result from the column that corresponds to the number of gold pieces in your Treasury.</p>

        <strong>Major Incident:</strong> Half the gold in your Treasury (rounding down to the nearest 5,000 gold pieces) is lost to an unfortunate mishap.

        <strong>Catastrophe:</strong> Your Treasury is emptied, except for 2D6 x 10,000 gold pieces which you sensibly squirreled away for just such an occurrence.

<h4>6. Prepare for Next Fixture</h4>
<p>In preparation for the next fixture, make sure both your Team Value and Current Team Value are up to date.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Team Value (TV):</dt>
    <dd>As described on <a href="#p35">page 35</a>, this is worked out by adding up the current value of all of the team's players, plus the cost of all Sideline Staff and team re-rolls the team has.</dd>
    <dt>Current Team Value (CTV):</dt>
    <dd>This is worked out exactly as above, but minus the current value of any players that suffered a Miss Next Game Casualty table result during this game and will be unavailable to play next game. Remember to include the current value of any players that missed this game; they have now recovered from their injuries and are fit to play in the next game.</dd>

                <h3>Skills</h3>
<p>The following pages feature the complete list of Skills and Traits available to players. Be they Skills a player starts with, or Skills gained during the course of a league, all players will have a degree of access to General, Agility, Strength and Passing skills, and many will have access to Mutations. Traits are more unique, the result of a player's nature rather than something they can learn.</p>
<h4>Skill Use</h4>
<p>Players that are Standing and have not lost their Tackle Zone can use their Skills or Traits at any time, not just during their own activation. Players that are Prone or Stunned, or that have lost their Tackle Zone for any reason, cannot use any Skills or Traits unless otherwise stated in the Skill or Trait description:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can choose to use a Skill or Trait that modifies a dice roll after the dice roll has been made.</li>
    <li>All bonuses and/or modifiers from Skills or Traits can be combined.</li>
    <li>Unless the description states otherwise, a Skill or Trait can be used by more than one player per team turn.</li>
    <li>Unless the description states otherwise, a Skill or Trait can be used multiple times during each team turn.</li>
    <li>Unless a Skill or Trait is marked with an asterisk (*), its use is not compulsory (i.e., you do not have to use that Skill or Trait if you do not wish to). However, the use of a Skill or Trait marked with an asterisk (*) is compulsory.</li>

        <p>When this player performs a Block action (on its own or as part of a Blitz action), if the nominated target has a higher Strength characteristic than this player before counting offensive or defensive assists but after applying any other modifiers, roll a D6 and add this player’s Strength characteristic to the result. If the total is higher than the target’s Strength characteristic, this player increases their Strength characteristic to be equal to that of the target of the Block action, before counting offensive or defensive assists, for the duration of this Block action.</p>
<p>If this player has another Skill that allows them to perform more than one Block action, such as Frenzy, they must make a Dauntless roll before each separate Block action is performed.</p>

        <p>If this player is pushed back as the result of any block dice result being applied against them, they may choose to prevent the player that pushed them back from following-up. However, the player that pushed them back may continue to move as part of a Blitz action if they have Movement Allowance remaining or by Rushing.</p>
<p>This Skill cannot be used when this player is chain-pushed, against a player with the Ball &amp; Chain trait or against a player with the Juggernaut skill that performed the Block action as part of a Blitz.</p>

        <p>Every time this player performs a Block action (on its own or as part of a Blitz action), they must follow-up if the target is pushed back and if they are able. If the target is still Standing after being pushed back, and if this player was able to follow-up, this player must then perform a second Block action against the same target, again following-up if the target is pushed back.</p>
<p>If this player is performing a Blitz action, performing a second Block action will also cost them one square of their Movement Allowance. If this player has no Movement Allowance left to perform a second Block action, they must Rush to do so. If they cannot Rush, they cannot perform a second Block action.</p>
<p>Note that if an opposition player in possession of the ball is pushed back into your End Zone and is still Standing, a touchdown will be scored, ending the drive. In this case, the second Block action is not performed.</p>
<p>A player with this Skill cannot also have the Grab skill.</p>

        <p>This player can use this Skill when an opposition player they are Marking voluntarily moves out of a square within this player’s Tackle Zone. Roll a D6, adding the MA of this player to the roll and then subtracting the MA of the opposition player. If the result is 6 or higher, or if the roll is a natural 6, this player may immediately move into the square vacated by the opposition player (this player does not need to Dodge to make this move). If, however, the result is 5 or lower, or if the roll is a natural 1, this Skill has no further effect.</p>
<p>A player may use this Skill any number of times per turn, during either team’s turn. If an opposition player is being Marked by more than one player with this Skill, only one player may use it.</p>

        <p>When an opposition player declares a Block action targeting this player (on its own or as part of a Blitz action), or any Special action that targets this player, their coach must first roll a D6, even if this player has lost their Tackle Zone. On a roll of 1, the player cannot perform the declared action and the action is wasted.</p>

        <p>This player can use this Skill when an opposition player they are Marking voluntarily moves out of a square within this player’s Tackle Zone. Roll a D6, adding the ST of this player to the roll and then subtracting the ST of the opposition player. If the result is 6 or higher, or if the roll is a natural 6, the opposition player is held firmly in place and their movement comes to an end. If, however, the result is 5 or lower, or if the roll is a natural 1, this Skill has no further effect.</p>
<p>A player may use this Skill any number of times per turn, during either team’s turn. If an opposition player is being Marked by more than one player with this Skill, only one player may use it.</p>

        <p>If this player is nominated as the target of a Block action (or a Special action granted by a Skill or Trait that can be performed instead of a Block action) and if they are in possession of the ball, they may immediately perform a Quick Pass action, interrupting the activation of the opposition player performing the Block action (or Special action) to do so. This Quick Pass action cannot cause a Turnover, but otherwise all of the normal rules for passing the ball apply. Once the Quick Pass action is resolved, the active player performs the Block action and their team turn continues.</p>

        <p>When this player performs a Pass action (or a Throw Bomb action), the target square can be anywhere on the pitch and the range ruler does not need to be used. A Hail Mary pass is never accurate, regardless of the result of the Passing Ability test it will always be inaccurate at best. A Passing Ability test is made and can be re-rolled as normal in order to determine if the Hail Mary pass is wildly inaccurate or is fumbled. A Hail Mary pass cannot be interfered with. This Skill may not be used in a Blizzard.</p>

        <p>A team which has one or more players with this Skill gains a single extra team re-roll, called a Leader re-roll. However, the Leader re-roll can only be used if there is at least one player with this Skill on the pitch (even if the player with this Skill is Prone, Stunned or has lost their Tackle Zone). If all players with this Skill are removed from play before the Leader re-roll is used, it is lost. The Leader re-roll can be carried over into extra time if it is not used, but the team does not receive a new one at the start of extra time. Unlike standard Team Re-rolls, the Leader Re-roll cannot be lost due to a Halfling Master Chef. Otherwise, the Leader re-roll is treated just like a normal team re-roll.</p>

        <p>This player may move up to three squares (regardless of their MA), following all of the normal movement rules, when the opposing coach declares that one of their players is going to perform a Pass action. This move is made after the range has been measured and the target square declared, but before the active player makes a Passing Ability test. Making this move interrupts the activation of the opposition player performing the Pass action. A player may use this Skill when an opposition player uses the Dump-Off skill, but should this player Fall Over whilst moving, a Turnover is caused.</p>
<p>Additionally, during each Start of Drive sequence, after Step 2 but before Step 3, one Open player with this Skill on the receiving team may move up to three squares (regardless of their MA). This Skill may not be used if a touchback is caused when the kick deviates and does not allow the player to cross into their opponent’s half of the pitch.</p>

        <p>When this player performs a Block action on its own (but not as part of a Blitz action), they may choose to perform two Block actions, each targeting a different player they are Marking. However, doing so will reduce this player’s Strength characteristic by 2 for the duration of this activation. Both Block actions are performed simultaneously, meaning both are resolved in full even if one or both result in a Turnover. The dice rolls for each Block action should be kept separate to avoid confusion. This player cannot follow-up when using this Skill.</p>
<p>Note that choosing to use this Skill means this player will be unable to use the Frenzy skill during the same activation.</p>

        <p>When this player is activated, even if they are Prone or have lost their Tackle Zone, immediately after declaring the action they will perform but before performing the action, roll a D6, applying a +2 modifier to the dice roll if you declared the player would perform a Block or Blitz action (or a Special action granted by a Skill or Trait that can be performed instead of a Block action):</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 1-3, this player lashes out at their team-mates:
<ul>
<li>One Standing team-mate of your choice that is currently adjacent to this player is immediately Knocked Down by this player. This does not cause a Turnover unless the Knocked Down player was in possession of the ball. After making an Armour roll(and possible Injury roll) against the Knocked Down player, this player may continue their activation and complete their declared action if able. Note that, if this player has any applicable Skills, the coach of the opposing team may use them when making an Armour roll (and possible Injury roll) against the Knocked Down player.</li>
<li>If this player is not currently adjacent to any Standing team-mates, this player’s activation ends immediately. Additionally, this player loses their Tackle Zone until they are next activated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On a roll of 4+, this player continues their activation as normal and completes their declared action.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you declared that this player would perform an action which can only be performed once per team turn and this player’s activation ended before the action could be completed, the action is considered to have been performed and no other player on your team may perform the same action this team turn.</p>

        <p>This player is jealous of and dislikes certain other players on their team, as shown in brackets after the name of the Skill on this player’s profile. This may be defined by position or race. For example, a Skaven Thrower on an Underworld Denizens team has Animosity (Underworld Goblin Linemen), meaning they suffer Animosity towards any Underworld Goblin Linemen players on their team. Whereas a Skaven Renegade on a Chaos Renegade team has Animosity (all team-mates), meaning they suffer Animosity towards all of their team-mates equally.</p>
<p>When this player wishes to perform a Hand-off action to a team-mate of the type listed, or attempts to perform a Pass action and the target square is occupied by a team-mate of the type listed, this player may refuse to do so. Roll a D6. On a roll of 1, this player refuses to perform the action and their activation comes to an end. Animosity does not extend to Mercenaries or Star Players.</p>

    <div>
        <p>When this player is activated, the only action they may perform is a ‘Ball &amp; Chain Move’ Special action. There is no limit to how many players with this Trait may perform this Special action each team turn.</p>
<p>When this player performs this Special action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the Throw-in template over the player, facing towards either End Zone or either sideline as you wish.</li>
<li>Roll a D6 and move the player one square in the direction indicated.</li>
<li>A player with a Ball &amp; Chain automatically passes any Agility tests they may be required to make in order to Dodge, regardless of any modifiers.</li>
<li>If this movement takes the player off the pitch, they risk Injury by the Crowd.</li>
<li>If this movement takes the player into a square in which the ball is placed, the player is considered to have moved involuntarily. Therefore, they may not attempt to pick the ball up and the ball will bounce.</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat this process for each square the player moves.</p>
<p>If this player would move into a square that is occupied by a Standing player from either team, they must perform a Block action against that player, following the normal rules, but with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Ball &amp; Chain player ignores the Foul Appearance skill.</li>
<li>A Ball &amp; Chain player must follow-up if they push-back another player.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this player moves into a square that is occupied by a Prone or Stunned player from either team, for any reason, that player is immediately pushed back and an Armour roll is made against them.</p>
<p>This player may Rush. Declare that the player will Rush before placing the Throw-in template and rolling the D6 to determine direction:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this player Rushes into an unoccupied square, move them as normal and roll a D6:
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 2+, this player moves without mishap.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1 (before or after modification), the player Falls Over.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If this player Rushes into a square that is occupied by a standing player from either team, roll a D6:
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 2+, this player moves without mishap and will perform a Block action against the player occupying the square as described previously.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1 (before or after modification), the player occupying the square is pushed back and this player will Fall Over after moving into the vacated square.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If this player ever Falls Over, is Knocked Down or is Placed Prone, an Injury roll is immediately made against them (no Armour roll is required), treating a Stunned result as a KO’d result.</p>
<p>A player with this Trait cannot also have the Diving Tackle, Frenzy, Grab, Leap, Multiple Block, On the Ball or Shadowing skills.</p>

        <p>When activated and if they are Standing, this player can perform a ‘Throw Bomb’ Special action. This Special action is neither a Pass action nor a Throw Team-Mate action, so does not prevent another player performing one of those actions during the same team turn. However, only a single player with this Trait may perform this Special action each team turn.</p>
<p>A Bomb can be thrown and caught, and the throw interfered with, just like a ball, using the rules for Pass actions as described on page 48, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A player may not stand up or move before performing a Throw Bomb action.</li>
<li>Bombs do not bounce and can come to rest on the ground in an occupied square. Should a player fail to catch a Bomb, it will come to rest on the ground in the square that player occupies.</li>
<li>If a Bomb is fumbled, it will explode immediately in the square occupied by the player attempting to throw it.</li>
<li>If a Bomb comes to rest on the ground in an empty square or is caught by an opposition player, no Turnover is caused.</li>
<li>A player that is in possession of the ball can still catch a Bomb.</li>
<li>Any Skills that can be used when performing a Pass action can also be used when performing a Throw Bomb Special action, with the exception of On the Ball.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a Bomb is caught by a player on either team, roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 4+, the Bomb explodes immediately, as described below.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1-3, that player must throw the Bomb again immediately. This throw takes place out of the normal sequence of play.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should a Bomb ever leave the pitch, it explodes in the crowd with no effect (on the game) before the crowd can throw it back.</p>
<p>When a Bomb comes to rest on the ground, in either an unoccupied square, in a square occupied by a player that failed to catch the Bomb or in a square occupied by a Prone or Stunned player, it will explode immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Bomb explodes in an occupied square, that player is automatically hit by the explosion.</li>
<li>Roll a D6 for each player (from either team) that occupies a square adjacent to the one in which the Bomb exploded:
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the explosion.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the explosion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any Standing players hit by the explosion are <del class="errata">Knocked Down</del> <ins class="errata">Placed Prone</ins>.</li>
<li>An Armour roll (and possibly an Injury roll as well) is made against any player hit by the explosion, even if they were already Prone or Stunned.</li>
<li>
<del class="errata">You may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll.</del>
</li>
<li>
<ins class="errata">If the player performing the Throw Bomb Special action is hit by their bomb and Placed Prone, either as the result of a Fumbled throw or by being hit by the explosion, then a Turnover is caused.</ins>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.</p>

        <p>Instead of performing a Block action (on its own or as part of a Blitz action), this player may perform a ‘Chainsaw Attack’ Special action. Exactly as described for a Block action, nominate a single Standing player to be the target of the Chainsaw Attack Special action. There is no limit to how many players with this Trait may perform this Special action each team turn.</p>
<p>To perform a Chainsaw Attack Special action, roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 2+, the nominated target is hit by a Chainsaw!</li>
<li>On a roll of 1, the Chainsaw will violently ‘kick-back’ and hit the player wielding it. <ins class="errata">This will result in a Turnover.</ins>
</li>
<li>In either case, an Armour roll is made against the player hit by the Chainsaw, adding +3 to the result.</li>
<li>If the armour of the player hit is broken, they become Prone and an Injury roll is made against them. This Injury roll cannot be modified in any way.</li>
<li>If the armour of the player hit is not broken, this Trait has no effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>This player can only use the Chainsaw once per turn(i.e., a Chainsaw cannot be used with Frenzy or Multiple Block) and if used as part of a Blitz action, this player cannot continue moving after using it.</p>
<p>If this player Falls Over or is Knocked Down, the opposing coach may add +3 to the Armour roll made against the player.</p>
<p>If an opposition player performs a Block action targeting this player and a Player Down! or a POW! result is applied, +3 is added to the Armour roll. If a Both Down result is applied, +3 is added to both Armour rolls.</p>
<p>Finally, this player may use their Chainsaw when they perform a Foul action. Roll a D6 for kick-back as described above. Once again, an Armour roll is made against the player hit by the Chainsaw, adding +3 to the score.</p>

<p>To perform a Hypnotic Gaze Special action, nominate a single Standing opposition player that has not lost their Tackle Zone and that this player is Marking.

This may be defined by position or race. For example, a Skaven Thrower on an Underworld Denizens team has Animosity (Underworld Goblin Linemen), meaning they suffer Animosity towards any Underworld Goblin Linemen players on their team. Whereas a Skaven Renegade on a Chaos Renegade team has Animosity (all team-mates), meaning they suffer Animosity towards all of their team-mates equally.</p>
<p>When this player wishes to perform a Hand-off action to a team-mate of the type listed, or attempts to perform a Pass action and the target square is occupied by a team-mate of the type listed, this player may refuse to do so. Roll a D6. On a roll of 1, this player refuses to perform the action and their activation comes to an end. Animosity does not extend to Mercenaries or Star Players.</p>

<p>To perform a Kick Team-Mate Special action, follow the rules for Throw Team-Mate actions as described on page 52.</p>
<p>However, if the Kick Team-Mate Special action is fumbled, the kicked player is automatically removed from play and an Injury roll is made against them, treating a Stunned result as a KO’d result (note that, if the player that performed this action also has the Mighty Blow (+X) skill, the coach of the opposing team may use that Skill on this Injury roll). If the kicked player was in possession of the ball when removed from play, the ball will bounce from the square they occupied.</p>

        <p>If this player wishes to use a team re-roll, roll a D6. If you roll equal to or higher than the target number shown in brackets, this player may use the team re-roll as normal. Otherwise, the original result stands without being re-rolled but the team re-roll is lost just as if it had been used.</p>
<p><ins class="errata">This Trait must still be used if the player is Prone or has lost their Tackle Zone.</ins></p>

        <p>This player is unable to take possession of the ball. They may not attempt to pick it up, to catch it, or attempt to interfere with a pass. Any attempt to do so will automatically fail, causing the ball to bounce. Should this player voluntarily move into a square in which the ball is placed, they cannot attempt to pick it up. The ball will bounce and a Turnover is caused as if this player had failed an attempt to pick up the ball.</p>

        <p>Once per game, if an opposition player with a Strength characteristic of 4 or less that does not have the Decay, Regeneration or Stunty traits suffers a Casualty result of 15-16, DEAD as the result of a Block action performed or a Foul action committed by a player with this Trait that belongs to your team, and if that player cannot be saved by an apothecary, you may choose to use this Trait. If you do, that player does not die; they have instead been infected with a virulent plague!</p>
<p>If your team has the ‘Favoured of Nurgle’ special rule, a new ‘Rotter Lineman’ player, drawn from the Nurgle roster, can be placed immediately in the Reserves box of your team’s dugout (this may cause a team to have more than 16 players for the remainder of this game). During step 4 of the post-game sequence, this player may be permanently hired, exactly as you would a Journeyman player that had played for your team (see page 72).</p>

    <div>
        <p>Instead of performing a Block action (on its own or as part of a Blitz action), this player may perform a ‘Projectile Vomit’ Special action. Exactly as described for a Block action, nominate a single Standing player to be the target of the Projectile Vomit Special action. There is no limit to how many players with this Trait may perform this Special action each team turn.</p>
<p>To perform a Projectile Vomit Special action, roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 2+, this player regurgitates acidic bile onto the nominated target.</li>
<li>On a roll of 1, this player belches and snorts, before covering itself in acidic bile.</li>
<li>In either case, an Armour roll is made against the player hit by the Projectile Vomit. This Armour roll cannot be modified in any way.</li>
<li>If the armour of the player hit is broken, they become Prone and an Injury roll is made against them. This Injury roll cannot be modified in any way.</li>
<li>If the armour of the player hit is not broken, this Trait has no effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>A player can only perform this Special action once per turn (i.e., Projectile Vomit cannot be used with Frenzy or Multiple Block).</p>

        <p>When this player is activated, even if they are Prone or have lost their Tackle Zone, immediately after declaring the action they will perform but before performing the action, roll a D6, applying a +2 modifier to the dice roll if this player is currently adjacent to one or more Standing team-mates that do not have this Trait:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 1-3, this player forgets what they are doing and their activation ends immediately. Additionally, this player loses their Tackle Zone until they are next activated.</li>
<li>On a roll of 4+, this player continues their activation as normal and completes their declared action.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if you declared that this player would perform an action which can only be performed once per team turn and this player’s activation ended before the action could be completed, the action is considered to have been performed and no other player on your team may perform the same action this team turn.</p>

        <p>Instead of performing a Block action (on its own or as part of a Blitz action), this player may perform a ‘Stab’ Special action. Exactly as described for a Block action, nominate a single Standing player to be the target of the Stab Special action. There is no limit to how many players with this Trait may perform this Special action each team turn.</p>
<p>To perform a Stab Special action, make an unmodified Armour roll against the target:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Armour of the player hit is broken, they become Prone and an Injury roll is made against them. This Injury roll cannot be modified in any way.</li>
<li>If the Armour of the player hit is not broken, this Trait has no effect.</li>
<li>If Stab is used as part of a Blitz action, the player cannot continue moving after using it.</li>
</ul>

        <p>When this player makes an Agility test in order to Dodge, they ignore any -1 modifiers for being Marked in the square they have moved into, unless they also have either the Bombardier trait, the Chainsaw trait or the Swoop trait.</p>
<p>However, when an opposition player attempts to interfere with a Pass action performed by this player, that player may apply a +1 modifier to their Agility test.</p>
<p>Finally, players with this Trait are more prone to injury. Therefore, when an Injury roll is made against this player, roll 2D6 and consult the Stunty Injury table, on page 60.</p>
<p><ins class="errata">This Trait must still be used if the player is Prone, Stunned, or has lost their Tackle Zone.</ins></p>

        <p>During each Start of Drive sequence, after Step 2 but before Step 3, you may remove D3 players with this Trait from the Reserves box of your dugout and set them up on the pitch, allowing you to set up more than the usual 11 players. These extra players may not be placed on the Line of Scrimmage or in a Wide Zone.</p>
<p><ins class="errata">Swarming players must be set up in their team’s half.</ins></p>
<p><ins class="errata">When using Swarming, a coach may not set up more players with the Swarming trait onto the pitch than the number of friendly players with the Swarming trait that were already set up. So, if a team had 2 players with the Swarming trait already set up on the pitch, and then rolled for 3 more players to enter the pitch via Swarming, only a maximum of 2 more Swarming players could be set up on the pitch.</ins></p>

Instead, you may place the Throw-in template over the player, facing towards either End Zone or either sideline as you wish. The player then moves from the target square D3 squares in a direction determined by rolling a D6 and referring to the Throw-in template.</p>

        <p>When this player is activated, even if they are Prone or have lost their Tackle Zone, immediately after declaring the action they will perform but before performing the action, roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a roll of 1, this player becomes ’Rooted’:
<ul>
<li>A Rooted player cannot move from the square they currently occupy for any reason, voluntarily or otherwise, until the end of this drive, or until they are Knocked Down or Placed Prone.</li>
<li>A Rooted player may perform any action available to them provided they can do so without moving. For example, a Rooted player may perform a Pass action but may not move before making the pass, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On a roll of 2+, this player continues their activation as normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you declared that this player would perform any action that includes movement (Pass, Hand-off, Blitz or Foul) prior to them becoming Rooted, they may complete the action if possible. If they cannot, the action is considered to have been performed and no other player on your team may perform the same action this team turn.</p>

</div>
                <div class="designers-commentary-qa-answer"><p>No. The Too Many Players rule is used when there are more players than the team is allowed on the pitch (usually 11). The Swarming trait increases the number of players that team is allowed to field by D3 for the duration of the drive so, as long as the team does not exceed the new limit, their players cannot be Sent-off for Too Many Players. If there are any players fielded above the new limit for the Swarming team, they can be Sent-off for Too Many Players as normal.</p>

                <h2>Inducements in Detail</h2>
<p>There are always plenty of hangers-on loitering around a Blood Bowl stadium. Be it legendary free agents willing to play for anyone if the price is right, or officials happy to take extra payment in return for being somewhat biased in their rulings, to unemployed coaching staff looking for a break and even a few apothecaries willing to roll up their sleeves. All these and more are willing to sign on with a team temporarily, for a price of course! Often, the stadium owners or promoters will foot the bill, willing to help out a disadvantaged team rather than risk a team refusing to play!</p>

                                
            </div>

                <h3>Inducements</h3>
<p>Blood Bowl teams are always looking for an advantage, be it fair or otherwise! Coaches will pay all manner of shady characters to assist their team from the sidelines or on the pitch. During the pre-game sequence of a league fixture, coaches may purchase Inducements for the game ahead by spending gold awarded as Petty Cash, taken from their Treasury or both. When creating a team for exhibition play, a coach may purchase Inducements from their Team Draft Budget.</p>
<h4>Inducements in League Play</h4>
<p>As described on <a href="#p35">page 35</a>, during the pre-game sequence of a league fixture, each team can spend gold pieces either from their Treasury, from Petty Cash (see <a href="#p38">page 38</a>) or both, to purchase any of the Inducements available to them which are then recorded on the team's Game Record sheet.</p>
<h4>Inducements in Exhibition Play</h4>
<p>When a team is drafted for exhibition play, you may spend as much or as little of your Team Draft Budget as you wish on Inducements, provided your team contains the minimum of 11 players, not including Induced Star Players.</p>
<p>If you are drafting a team for exhibition play to be used at an event or tournament, you should pay close attention to the rulespack created by the organisers, as it is quite common that not all Inducements will be allowed. Also, it is common for tournament organisers to create their own, special Inducements.</p>
<p>If two coaches are drafting teams for exhibition play between themselves, they should take a few minutes to discuss Inducements first. It is important to decide if there are any Inducements they feel should be included or any they would prefer to leave out.</p>
<h4>Common Inducements</h4>
<p>Below is a list of the common Inducements. There are many more Inducements and most teams have access to their own, unique Inducements as well. More Inducements can be found in the various Blood Bowl supplements available:</p>

                <h5>
    <strong>0-4 Temp Agency Cheerleaders</strong> – 20,000 gold pieces each
</h5>
<p>Cheerleading isn't steady work and there are always young hopefuls looking for their big break, willing to bolster a depleted cheer squad on game day! In addition to hiring cheerleaders as permanent Sideline Staff, any team may temporarily purchase some Temp Agency Cheerleaders as Inducements. Simply increase the team's number of cheerleaders by the number Induced, up to a maximum of 16 in total, for the duration of the game.</p>
<p>At the end of the game, any Temp Agency Cheerleaders will leave the team.</p>
<h5>
    <strong>0-3 Part-time Assistant Coaches</strong> – 20,000 gold pieces each
</h5>
<p>Everyone's an expert, and if a coach is willing to pay, many will share that expertise with the team! In addition to hiring assistant coaches as permanent Sideline Staff, any team may temporarily purchase some Part-time Assistant Coaches as Inducements. Simply increase the team's number of assistant coaches by the number Induced, up to a maximum of nine in total, for the duration of the game.</p>
<p>At the end of the game, any Part-time Assistant Coaches will leave the team.</p>
<h5>
    <strong>0-1 Weather Mage</strong> – 30,000 gold pieces
</h5>
<p>Many stadium owners employ Weather Mages, paying good money for highly localised spells to control the elements to keep the fans dry and happy. Rarely does this magical climate control extend to the pitch though, unless a coach is willing to pay for the service that is! A Weather Mage is not a Wizard Inducement and a coach may Induce both a Weather Mage and a Wizard of some sort.</p>
<p>You may use a Weather Mage once per game, at the start of any one of your team turns, before activating any of your players. Roll on the Weather table, applying a modifier of +1 or +2, or -1 or -2 if desired. The resulting weather conditions are applied immediately and will last until the end of the opposition's next team turn, replacing the existing weather conditions. At the end of opposition's next team turn or the end of the drive (whichever comes first), the replaced weather conditions will return.</p>
<h5>
    <strong>0-2 Bloodweiser Kegs</strong> – 50,000 gold pieces each
</h5>
<p>Nothing says “get back in the game” like a frosty Bloodweiser Ale served straight from the keg. There's probably an official rule regarding drinking during a game, but whether it's compulsory or banned, who cares! For each Bloodweiser Keg Induced, you may apply a +1 modifier to the result of any dice rolls made during this game when rolling to see if any of your players recovers from being KO'd. Bloodweiser Kegs benefit all players currently on the team, including Journeymen, Star Players and Mercenaries.</p>
<h5>
    <strong>0-5 Special Plays</strong> – 100,000 gold pieces each
</h5> Each Special Plays Inducement purchased gives you one Special Plays card to use during the game ahead. Cards are drawn from one or more of the Special Plays card decks during the Inducements step of the pre-game sequence:
<ul>
    <li>Each Special Plays Inducement purchased allows you to draw cards from a single deck.</li>
    <li>The deck from which cards are drawn is determined by rolling a D6 and consulting the table below.</li>
    <li>For each separate Special Plays Inducement purchased, roll again on the table below.</li>
    <li>There is no limit to how many cards may be drawn from each deck, but if the second roll or any subsequent rolls give a duplicated result, you may re-roll the D6. If the D6 is re-rolled, you must accept the result of the re-roll.</li>
</ul>

    <strong>Card Selection:</strong> Once the D6 has been rolled, the appropriate Special Plays card deck is shuffled and two cards are drawn from the top. You may then read both cards before choosing one to keep and one to discard.

                <h5>
    <strong>0-8 Extra Team Training</strong> – 100,000 gold pieces each
</h5>
<p>Getting all of the players together in the same place is hard enough on game day, let alone for a regular training session. If a coach wants to hold extra training sessions ahead of an important fixture, they had better be prepared to flash some cash to Induce the cooperation of their players! Each Extra Team Training session grants the team an extra team re-roll for each half of this game.</p>
<h5>
    <strong>0-3 Bribes</strong> – 100,000 gold pieces each (50,000 gold pieces for teams with the 'Bribery and Corruption' special rule)
</h5>
<p>When a player is caught misbehaving, a bag of gold pieces can have a surprisingly calming effect upon an angered referee! A single Bribe may be used when a player is Sent-off for committing a Foul or using a Secret Weapon. To use a Bribe, roll a D6. On a roll of 2-6, the Bribe is effective and the player is not Sent-off (and no Turnover is caused), but on a roll of 1 the Bribe is wasted and the referee's decision still stands! Each Bribe may be used once per game.</p>
<p>A single Bribe may be used after an attempt to Argue the Call has been made. However, if a 1 was rolled when attempting to Argue the Call and the head coach ejected, as described on <a href="#p63">page 63</a>, the ref is annoyed beyond the calming effects of mere gold and no Bribe may be used this time!</p>
<h5>
    <strong>0-2 Wandering Apothecaries</strong> – 100,000 gold pieces each (not available to teams that cannot hire an apothecary)
</h5>
<p>Any team that can normally hire an apothecary may Induce a Wandering Apothecary or two to help during the game. Often these apothecaries are local barber surgeons, present for the game and willing to recoup the price of their ticket by helping out. Others are experts of questionable veracity, hoping to prove the worth of their unorthodox methods. Wandering Apothecaries follow all the rules for normal apothecaries, as described on <a href="#p62">page 62</a>. However, unlike a normal apothecary, a Wandering Apothecary may attempt to patch-up any Journeymen or Mercenary players the team includes, but cannot attempt to patch up a Star Player.</p>
<h5>
    <strong>0-1 Mortuary Assistant</strong> – 100,000 gold pieces (only available to teams with the 'Sylvanian Spotlight' special rule)
</h5>
<p>Necromancers are always looking for a helping hand with their work, and the local mortuary workers are often eager to earn some extra income. A Mortuary Assistant is a master of needle, thread and twisted wire, connecting hip bone to leg bone, repairing funeral bindings, and so on. They can really get the players shambling back to the pitch! A Mortuary Assistant may be used once per game to re-roll one failed Regeneration roll for any player currently on the team, including Journeymen, but not including Mercenaries or Star Players.</p>
<h5>
    <strong>0-1 Plague Doctor</strong> – 100,000 gold pieces (only available to teams with the 'Favoured of Nurgle' special rule)
</h5>
<p>The Plague Doctors that accompany Nurgle-aligned teams are well-versed in the care of the many virulent plagues and ailments that infect their charges. Once per game, a Plague Doctor may be used to re-roll one failed Regeneration roll for a player on their team. Alternatively, once per game the Plague Doctor may be used in exactly the same way as an apothecary when any player on their team is Knocked-out (see <a href="#p62">page 62</a>). Plague Doctors benefit all players currently on the team, including Journeymen, but not including Mercenaries or Star Players.</p>
<h5>
    <strong>0-1 Riotous Rookies</strong> – 100,000 gold pieces (only available to teams with the 'Low Cost Linemen' special rule)
</h5>
<p>Ahead of the game the head coach ventures outside the stadium armed with handfuls of small change and dried beans which they fling to the adoring crowd, telling them they have been hired and this game is their big break in Blood Bowl. Regardless of how many players are available for this game and in addition to any Journeymen the team gains for free to make up for any lack of players, your team gains an additional 2D3+1 Journeymen for this game. These fresh-faced young hopefuls may take the number of players on your Team Draft list temporarily above 16. They are normal Journeyman players in every other respect and unless hired in the post-game sequence, they will be sent on their merry way once the game has ended.</p>

    <strong>0-1 Halfling Master Chef</strong> – 300,000 gold pieces (100,000 gold pieces for
    <del class="errata">teams with the 'Halfling Thimble Cup' special rule</del>
    <ins class="errata">Halfling Teams</ins>
    )
</h5>
<p>The entourage of many teams can include several world-class chefs who busy themselves with preparing the halftime and fulltime banquets for the players. The delicious aromas emanating from the team's dugout all too often distract the opposition as much as they invigorate your players! At the start of both the first and second half, after step 2 but before step 3 of the Start of Drive sequence, roll three D6. For each roll of a 4+, your team is so inspired they gain an extra team re-roll for this half. In addition, the opposing team is so distracted that for each roll of a 4+, they will lose one of their team re-rolls for this half.</p>
<h5>
    <strong>Unlimited Mercenary Players</strong> – price varies
</h5>
<p>For every player safely employed by a team, there are dozens more who will wear anyone's colours in exchange for hard currency. You may Induce Mercenary players to your team for a single game, chosen from your Team Roster, at 30,000 gold pieces more than the player would normally cost. For example, a Mercenary Human Lineman would cost 80,000 gold pieces to hire for a game rather than the usual 50,000 gold pieces.</p>
<p>The normal limits on the total number of players allowed on a team and in each position apply to Mercenaries. However, players that are missing the game due to injury do not count towards the number of players on the team, so they are not counted when working out how many Mercenaries a team can have.</p>
<p>All Mercenaries have the Loner (4+) trait as they are not accustomed to playing with the rest of the team. In addition, a Mercenary may be given one additional Primary skill selected from those available to a player of that position, at an additional cost of 50,000 gold pieces. For example, a Mercenary Human Lineman could be given Tackle for a total cost of 130,000 gold pieces to hire for a game. Mercenaries do not earn Star Player points and cannot be awarded the MVP for the game. Unlike Journeymen, Mercenaries cannot be permanently hired during the post-game sequence.</p>
<h5>
    <strong>0-2 Star Players</strong> – price varies
</h5>
<p>These are the heroes of the Blood Bowl arena, the most resourceful and talented players in the sport. Star Players act as free agents, playing occasional games for any team that can afford their high fees (and that they are willing to assist in the first place), and then moving on to play for another team. A team may Induce up to two Star Players that are allowed to play for the team. Unless the league commissioner decides otherwise, any Casualty table results applied against a Star Player are waived after the game – they can afford all the resurrection spells they need!</p>
<p>
    Star Players may not take the number of players in the team to more than 16. However, players that are missing the game due to injury do not count towards the number of players on the team, so they are not counted when working out how many Star Players a team can have.
    <ins class="errata">
        Star Players that must be hired as a pair (such as Dribl & Drull or the Swift Twins) only count as a single Star Player choice. However, they will still take up two spaces on a team’s Team Roster.
    </ins>
</p>
<p>It is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same Star Player:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can field the Star Player but the Star Player will keep both hiring fees.</li>
    <li>If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can field the Star Player – one team has clearly hired a ringer!</li>
</ul>
<p>Star Players do not earn Star Player points and cannot be awarded the MVP for the game. Star Players can never gain advancements.</p>

    <strong>0-2 (In)Famous Coaching Staff</strong> – price varies
</h5>
<p>Although most Blood Bowl celebrities are players, with the occasional ref thrown in for good measure, there are several well-known members of coaching staff around the circuit. Many of these non-playing professionals are willing to offer out their services to other teams for the right price, bringing their expertise to the dugout.</p>
<p>(In)Famous Coaching Staff are available to purchase during the pre-game sequence at the cost listed. You may purchase up to two (In)Famous Coaching Staff who are allowed to assist your team. As with Star Players, it is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same named (In)Famous Coaching Staff (such as Josef Bugman):</p>
<ul>
    <li>If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can use the (In)Famous Coaching Staff but the (In)Famous Coaching Staff will keep both hiring fees.</li>
    <li>If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can use the (In)Famous Coaching Staff – one team has clearly hired a ringer!</li>
</ul>
<p>There are too many (In)Famous Coaching Staff to list here, and most are only available to certain teams. Details of further (In)Famous Coaching Staff can be found in the various Blood Bowl supplements available.</p>
<h5>
    <strong>0-2 (In)Famous Coaching Staff Inducement: Josef Bugman</strong> – 100,000 Gold Pieces, available to any team
</h5>
<p>The name Josef Bugman is synonymous with Blood Bowl. With numerous sponsorship deals across the Old World, stocks of Bugman's XXXXXX can be found in most Blood Bowl stadia; the amber liquid making sure the crowd is suitably rowdy by kick-off. When Bugman turns up to a game in-person it is a spectacle to behold! As he enters the stadium he greets the cheering crowd. In his wake Dwarf cheerleaders dance through the crowd with beer cannon, whilst the Bugman's Blimp flies overhead dropping flagons of fine ale into the upraised hands of the spectators.</p>
<p>But Bugman is no mere spectator; the stout brewer owns and coaches numerous teams. For all his bluster, Bugman is a fair coach, having a good eye for the ebb and flow of the game – the problem arises when things don't go his team's way, or he gets excessively drunk, or some combination of the two, and he staggers out onto the field to take matters into his own hands…</p>
<h6>Bugmans XXXXXX</h6>
<p>Bugman provides players on his team with an ample supply of Bugman's XXXXXX. This most famous of Dwarf ales is renowned for its recuperative properties. When rolling to see if Knocked-out players recover, rolls of a 1 can be re-rolled.</p>
<h6>Keen Player</h6>
<p>If Bugman's team cannot set up 11 players at the start of a drive, Bugman may decide to join in himself! You can choose to set him up as part of your team. If you do so, he counts as part of the team for the duration of the drive. When the drive ends, Bugman is Sent-off for committing a Foul and has no further effect on the game – he cannot be used in a later drive. The Bugman's XXXXXX, however, is not lost; the players simply refuse to give it up! Bugman has the following profile:</p>

    <strong>0-1 Wizard</strong> – price varies
</h5>
<p>Wizards of the various Arcane Colleges find ready employment with the many Cabalvision networks, as it takes huge amounts of magical energy to capture the action and beam it globally to the crystal balls and magic mirrors of Cabalvision subscribers around the world. Consequently, there are always Wizards to be found at any given fixture, card carrying members of the Colleges of Magic, all more than happy to moonlight for a team wishing to secure their assistance.</p>
<p>No team may purchase more than one Wizard Inducement per game.</p>
<p>Some Wizards are named, although most are not. As with Star Players, it is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same named Wizard:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can use the named Wizard but the named Wizard will keep both hiring fees.</li>
    <li>If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can use the named Wizard– one team has clearly hired a ringer!</li>
</ul>
<p>If a Wizard Inducement is not named, there is no restriction on both teams fielding the same type. There are too many types of</p>
<p>Wizard to list here, and most are only available to certain teams. Details of further Wizards can be found in the various Blood Bowl supplements available.</p>
<h5>
    <strong>0-1 Wizard Inducement: Hireling Sports-Wizard</strong> – 150,000 Gold Pieces, available to any team
</h5>
<p>The spells a Hireling Sports Wizard will use are carefully selected to amaze and amuse the fans in equal measure. Many spectacular fireballs explode on pitches just as often as opposition players are turned into frogs. A player turned into a frog can be turned back quite quickly with no more lasting consequences than an inexplicable desire to sit on a log and eat flies (if they're lucky enough to be changed back at all, that is!).</p>
<p>Once per game, a Hireling Sports-Wizard may cast one of the following spells:</p>
<h6>Fireball</h6>
<del class="block errata">
    <p>You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Choose a target square anywhere on the pitch and roll a D6 for each Standing player (from either team) that occupies either the target square or a square adjacent to it:</p>
</del>
<ins class="block errata">
    <p>You may cast this spell at the end of either player’s team turn, before the next team turn begins.</p>
</ins>
<ul>
    <li>On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the Fireball.</li>
    <li>On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the Fireball.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any Standing players hit by the Fireball are Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Fireball, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.</p>
<h6>Zap!</h6>
<p>You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Target any opposition player and roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the roll is equal to or higher than the player's Strength characteristic, or is a natural 6, that player turns into a frog for the remainder of the drive, after which their coach will secure emergency magical assistance to turn the player back into their original form.</li>
    <li>If the roll is lower than the player's Strength characteristic, the player develops a fresh crop of warts, but the spell has no further effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the player was in possession of the ball when they were turned into a frog, it is dropped and will bounce. When a roll on the Casualty table is required against the frog, no roll is made. Instead, it is automatically treated as if a Badly Hurt result had been rolled. The frog must miss the rest of the game and cannot be patched-up by an apothecary (because it's a frog!). At the end of the game, the player is returned to normal shape with no ill effects.</p>
<p>The frog has the following profile:</p>

                <h5>
    <strong>0-1 Biased Referee</strong> – price varies
</h5>
<p>Many referees become celebrities in their own right, sometimes for their even-handed application of the rules, more often for their blatant corruption or violent outbursts! Many teams will go out of their way to bribe a ref, but nothing beats turning up to a game knowing that the ref is not only on your payroll, but is practically a part of your team!</p>
<p>Biased Referees are available to purchase during the pre-game sequence at the cost listed, and because Blood Bowl games tend to be officiated over by a group rather than a single individual, both teams may purchase a Biased Referee. You may purchase one Biased Referee to treat your team favourably during the game ahead.</p>
<p>For the most part, a Biased Referee will treat both teams equally, meaning that they follow all of the normal referee rules as described on <a href="#p63">page 63</a>. Where they differ is that they will be either far more harsh in their scrutiny of the opposition or far more lenient in their treatment of the team that has paid them off. How this manifests is described in each Biased Referee's description.</p>
<p>Many Biased Referees are named celebrities, although most are not. As with Star Players, it is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same named Biased Referee:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can use the named Biased Referee but the named Biased Referee will keep both hiring fees.</li>
    <li>If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can use the named Biased Referee – they can dish out harsh rulings to both sides! There are too many named Biased Referees to list here, and most are only available to certain teams. Details of further Biased Referees can be found in the various Blood Bowl supplements available.</li>
</ul>
<h5>
    <strong>0-1 Biased Referee Inducement</strong> – 120,000 Gold Pieces (80,000 Gold Pieces for teams with the 'Bribery and Corruption' Special Rule), available to any team
</h5>
<p>In the years since the collapse of the NAF, there has been a marked increase of RARG members who show blatant bias. Whilst most referees are happy to accept bribes on a case by case basis, many others have started offering their services to a favoured team for an entire game!</p>
<h6>Close Scrutiny</h6>
<p>Strict adherence to the rules is of paramount importance to all referees. This is especially true when one of the teams has paid them to watch the opposition closely! If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul without rolling a double when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:</p>
<ul>
    <li>On a roll of 5+, the Biased Referee spots the Foul and the player is Sent-off, exactly as if they had rolled a double (i.e., the opposing coach may use a Bribe if one is available and may attempt to Argue the Call).</li>
    <li>On a roll of 1-4, the player manages to avoid the ref's attention.</li>
</ul>
<h6>"I didn't See a Thing"</h6>
<p>Whilst watching one team incredibly closely, the Biased Referee can easily be forgiven for missing infractions perpetrated by the other. When rolling on the Argue the Call table, you may apply a +1 modifier to the dice roll.</p>

                <h2>League and Exhibition Play</h2>
<p>Playing a Blood Bowl league is great fun. Teams grow and develop, and rookie players blossom into mighty Star Players. Coaches are able to build upon their team's background and rivalries with others, all the while hoping to reach the play-offs, dreaming of winning lasting fame and fortune.</p>
<p>In truth, although we call them leagues, what our teams are most likely doing is participating in the type of tournaments that happen around the Old World and beyond all the time. There haven't been many formal leagues since the NAF collapsed, and teams travel the known world taking part in numerous privately run tournaments, playing a series of linked games, hoping to qualify for the finals and to win the prizes on offer. The development seen is a team improving through the course of such a competition and becoming a more skilled and complete unit. Over several such league seasons a team will have played in several different competitions in very different locations, gained new players, lost old favourites, and changed and evolved over time.</p>

                <h3>Running a League</h3>
<p>In order to set up a league, the first thing needed is a league commissioner. The league commissioner is the member of any group of regularly meeting coaches who takes up the responsibility for making sure that a league runs smoothly. Some league commissioners like to keep a central database of teams to keep track of how well everyone is doing, and some even write regular newsletters featuring game reports, league tables and anything else they can think of! Most league commissioners will take part in the league with a team of their own.</p>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>To run a league, you will need at least four teams. At the start of the league, each participating coach needs to draft a team as described on <a href="#p30">page 30</a> and submit a copy of their Team Draft list to the league commissioner.</p>
<h5>Seasons</h5>
<p>A Blood Bowl league plays out over a number of 'seasons', each split into the 'regular season' and the 'play-off season'. At the end of each play-off season, comes the 'off-season break', a rest from the action before the next season begins. After the off-season break, returning and new coaches alike can draft a new team for the season ahead. Should the league commissioner wish, returning coaches can re-draft an existing team as described on <a href="#p100">page 100</a>.</p>
<h5>Divisions</h5>
<p>If the league contains enough teams, the league commissioner may wish to divide them into two, three or four divisions. Each division should contain as equal a number of teams as possible, but a division should have no fewer than four teams. The larger the divisions are, the longer a season will last. The teams can be split however the league commissioner decides, but drawing team names out of an upturned Blood Bowl helmet (or similar receptacle) is most traditional. Once the divisions have been split, the season can begin!</p>
<h4>The Regular Season</h4>
<p>During a season, each team plays two 'league fixtures' against each other team in their division. These games should be played to a schedule of 'rounds', drawn up by the league commissioner and made available to all coaches. 'Cross division friendly' games can also be played on a challenge basis against teams in other divisions that a team and their coach may not otherwise face.</p>
<h5>League Fixtures</h5>
<p>It is recommended that you set a time limit for each round. This prevents the league stalling because two players can't seem to get their schedules to line up. A good rule for deciding a time limit is to assume that each team can play one game per week. Any league fixtures that have not been played by the end of the time limit count as a loss for both teams unless one coach voluntarily concedes due to real life commitments. In this case, the other team wins 1-0, gains D6x10,000 gold pieces and may make two MVP awards.</p>
<p>After a league fixture has been played, both teams follow the full post-game sequence as described on <a href="#p69">page 69</a>. Note that both coaches are responsible for correctly recording the outcome of the game and passing that information on to the league commissioner.</p>
<p>
    <strong>NO-SHOWS:</strong> If a coach is thought to be gaming the system – i.e., avoiding certain games just to prevent their opponent from getting a win or to protect their players from harm ahead of another game, the league commissioner should dock that coach 3 League points.
</p>
<h5>Cross Division Friendlies</h5>
<p>During the regular season, any two coaches that are not in the same division may arrange for their teams to play a friendly game. Each team can play as many or as few friendly games as they wish, but two teams can only play each other in this manner once. Coaches should note that during the post-game sequence of a friendly, no MVP is awarded and no League points are won. In all other respects, a friendly is treated just like a league fixture.</p>

                                
            </div>
                    <div id="p98" class="page">
                <a href="#p98" class="page-number">#98</a>
                <h5>League Scoring</h5>
<p>Teams earn League points as follows:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper">
    <table>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Win:</th>
            <td>3 League points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Draw:</th>
            <td>1 League point</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Loss:</th>
            <td>0 League points</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>Additionally, league commissioners may wish to award bonus League points for the following:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper">
    <table>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Score 3 or more touchdowns:</th>
            <td>+1 League point</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Concede 0 touchdowns:</th>
            <td>+1 League point</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Cause 3 or more Casualties (counting only those that generate SPP, as described in Step 3 of the post-game sequence):</th>
            <td>+1 League point</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>Each coach should record their League points on their Game Record sheet during step 1 of the post-game sequence, before reporting both the outcome of the game and the league points scored to the league commissioner.</p>
<h4>The Play-Off Season</h4>
<p>Once all league fixtures have been played in each division, the regular season comes to a close. Once all the scores are in, the league commissioner ranks the teams in order of League points, from highest to lowest, using total touchdowns as the first tiebreaker and total casualties as the second tiebreaker, if required. The top four teams in the league will go through to the play-offs as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the league consists of two divisions, the top two teams from each go through and the play-off season progresses straight to the semi-finals.</li>
    <li>If the league consists of four divisions:
        <ul>
            <li>The top team from each goes through and the play-off season progresses straight to the semi-finals.</li>
            <li>The top two teams from each go through and the play-off season commences with the quarter finals.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If the league consists of three divisions, the top team from each goes through. Additionally, the second place team with the highest number of league points will go through as a wild card. The play-off season progresses straight to the semi-finals.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the regular season, these games should be played to a schedule drawn up by the league commissioner and made available to all coaches.</p>
<p>If quarter finals are being played, care should be taken to ensure that two teams from the same division do not meet in either the quarter finals or semi-finals. Once the semi-finals have been played, the two winning teams will progress to the final, and the two losing teams will meet to decide 3rd place.</p>

                <h4>Glittering Prizes</h4>
<p>Prizes are awarded to the teams who finish in 1st, 2nd and 3rd place, in addition to any winnings generated during the post-game sequence:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The team in 3rd place receives 30,000 gold pieces.</li>
    <li>The team in 2nd place receives 60,000 gold pieces.</li>
    <li>The team who finished in 1st place, the season's champion, is awarded 100,000 gold pieces and the League Trophy.</li>
</ul>
<p>These winnings should not be placed in the team's Treasury until after the Expensive Mistakes step of the post-game sequence. Therefore, these winnings cannot be lost as soon as they are won!</p>
<p>The League Trophy is held by the winners until the end of the next season, when it will be awarded to the new champions. For as long as a team holds a League Trophy, it adds an additional team re-roll to its Team Draft list, increasing its Team Value accordingly but without having to spend any gold pieces from its Treasury.</p>
<h4>The Off-season Break And Re-drafting Teams</h4>
<p>Whilst many coaches like to start each season with a brand new team, many more like to develop a favourite team over several seasons, building that team's legend over time and telling the story of fan favourites who dedicate their career to their team. The following rules allow coaches who wish to re-draft a team from one season into the next to do so.</p>
<h5>Re-Drafting</h5>
<p>Between seasons, there is a period of downtime called the 'off-season break'. Coaches and their players rest and recuperate, spend their hard-earned gold, or go on elaborate tours to promote the latest edition of their increasingly unbelievable autobiographies. After the finals have been played, any coaches who wish to re-draft their team for the next season should get together with the league commissioner and run through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>R&amp;R:</strong> Players that would miss the team's next game recover.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>RAISE FUNDS</strong>: Coaches calculate the funds available to them to re-draft their team.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>RE-DRAFT:</strong> Coaches complete their new Team Draft list for the season ahead.
    </li>
</ol>
<h5>1. R&amp;R</h5>
<p>During the off-season break, players have time to rest and recuperate from their injuries. Therefore, any players that suffered a Miss Next Game Casualty table result during the team's final game of the season will recover before the next season begins.</p>
<h5>2. Raise Funds</h5>
<p>When re-drafting, each team gets a Re-Draft Budget of 1,000,000 gold pieces. This represents money doled out by the league, the team's sponsors, fan clubs and generous patrons. A team that is re-drafting then adds to this anything they have left in their Treasury from the previous season, after which their Treasury is emptied (presumably having been used to cover the cost of the many unexpected expenses that arise during the off-season break). Finally, a team that is re-drafting adds the bonuses listed below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>20,000 gold pieces for each game the team played last season (both friendlies and league fixtures).
        <ul>
            <li>+20,000 gold pieces for each league fixture the team won last season.</li>
            <li>+10,000 gold pieces for each league fixture the team played last season that ended in a draw.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>League commissioners may, at their own discretion, place a cap of 1,300,000 gold pieces on the Re-Draft Budget available to teams so that no team starts the season with too obvious an advantage.</p>

                                
            </div>
                    <div id="p100" class="page">
                <a href="#p100" class="page-number">#100</a>
                <h5>3. Re-draft</h5>
<p>Once the Re-Draft Budget available has been worked out, the team can be re-drafted. A few key players will be able to return to the pitch for the new season, whilst others will find themselves unceremoniously dropped and replaced with eager rookies to keep costs down. Those players that are dropped usually have the good grace to disappear quietly, heading off to seek their fortune in the backwater leagues, to become sports pundits on the interview circuit, or to host Cabalvision shows about redecorating your hovel.</p>
<p>To redraft your team, use a new Team Draft list and create a brand new version of your team using the Re-Draft Budget available, as described on
    <a href="#p99"><a href="#p99">page 99</a></a>. The following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assistant coaches and cheerleaders may be carried over from your previous Team Draft list at a cost 10,000 gold pieces each, or they may be let go.</li>
    <li>Apothecaries may be carried over from your previous Team Draft list at a cost 50,000 gold pieces each, or they may be let go.</li>
    <li>Team re-rolls may be carried over from your previous Team Draft list at the cost shown on your team roster, or they may be let go.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as hiring new players from your team roster, you can re-hire players from last season's Team Draft list. Players can be re-hired by paying their Current Value as shown on last season's Team Draft list, plus an agent's fee of 20,000 gold pieces for each previous season the player has taken part in. Simply copy the player's entire profile across from your old Team Draft list, including any Niggling Injuries, any characteristic reductions and any unspent Star Player points:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the player has any Niggling Injuries, roll a D6 for each, applying a +1 modifier to the dice roll if the team has an apothecary:
        <ul>
            <li>On a roll of 4+, some rest and relaxation has worked wonders. The Niggling Injury you are rolling for is removed.</li>
            <li>On a roll of 1-3, the player's injury has not yet fully healed. The Niggling Injury being rolled for remains.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ins class="block errata">
    <p>A team’s Dedicated Fans value will carry over onto the new Team Draft list. Teams do not have to pay for these, they are free – though they will still affect a team’s Team Value.</p>
</ins>
<h5>Re-drafting Temporarily Retired Players</h5>
<p>Additionally, players that temporarily retired during the last season can be re-hired as described previously by paying the cost shown for them on that season's Team Draft list. Hopefully the time off has helped them to recover from their injuries:</p>
<ul>
    <li>After the player has been re-drafted, roll a D6 for each characteristic reduction they have suffered, applying a +1 modifier to the dice roll if the team has an apothecary:
        <ul>
            <li>On a roll of 4+, some time off and some intensive therapy has done the job and the characteristic is restored. However, such injuries often leave their mark and the player will gain a Niggling Injury.</li>
            <li>On a roll of 1-3, the player's injury has not yet fully healed. The characteristic reduction being rolled for remains.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul> Note that if the player has suffered more than one characteristic reduction, you should roll for each separately.
<h4>Starting a New Season</h4>
<p>After the excitement of the play-off season and the thrill of the finals, the obvious question from most coaches is: when's the next season starting? The answer, as ever, is up to the league commissioner. Starting a new season is as easy as following these three steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The league commissioner establishes who will be taking part in the next season. This is a good chance for coaches to step down from the league if they're struggling to find the time to play, and it's an ideal opportunity for new teams to join in the fun.</li>
    <li>Each coach who is taking part in the new league season submits a Team Draft list.</li>
    <li>Teams are divided into divisions (if necessary) and dates are set. The season begins anew!</li>
</ul>

</div>
                <div class="designers-commentary-qa-answer"><p>Only for re-hiring a player in question.

                <h3>Exhibition Play</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, not everyone is able to commit the time required to take part in a league. Coaches may not live close to their gaming friends, work and family commitments might contrive to keep us away from our hobby, meaning that often we are only able to enjoy the occasional stand-alone game when time permits. Such stand-alone games are referred to as 'exhibition games'. What's more, there is no reason to miss out on the fun of many aspects of the game that appear to be designed for league play; it is possible to create teams for exhibition games complete with extra Skills, characteristic improvements and access to weird and wonderful Inducements, including Star Players. There is a lot of fun to be had in creating a team for an exhibition game, deciding what will be included and what will be left out, choosing Skills, creating names and backstories for the players, and so on.</p>
<h4>Blood Bowl Exhibition Play Rules</h4>
<p>The following pages offer a set of guidelines for creating exhibition play teams. Coaches who wish to use these rules for a game should decide between themselves on the details. Further, this section aims to give guidance to anyone wanting to run a Blood Bowl tournament, as these rules will help create more interesting teams for participants to use, which in turn will enhance the experience for everyone involved. Drafting an Exhibition Team</p>
<p>This section deals with how to create a team for an exhibition game. For the most part this is exactly the same as creating a team for a league, right down to using the usual team rosters and completing a Team Draft list. However, there are some distinct differences to be aware of:</p>
<h5>Team Draft Budget</h5>
<p>For exhibition games, coaches should have more gold in their Team Draft Budget, allowing them to include more of the options that normally only become available later on in a league.</p>
<p>The Team Draft Budget for exhibition play should be somewhere between 1,100,000 and 1,300,000 gold pieces. We have found that 1,150,000 gold pieces is an ideal size. Larger is possible should coaches or tournament organisers wish, but it is worth bearing in mind that smaller Team Draft Budgets force hard choices to be made. Sometimes, having to choose whether to include one thing or the other is better than having both as it adds to the challenge of the experience.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that when a team is drafted for exhibition play, all of the gold pieces in the Team Draft Budget must be spent. Any gold pieces not spent are lost. One consequence of this is that the Prayers to Nuffle table is only used for Cheering Fans in exhibition play, as described on <a href="#p41">page 41</a>.</p>
<p>A Team Draft list will need to be completed for the team, detailing all of the players, Sideline Staff and any Inducements purchased. This is especially important when attending a Blood Bowl tournament, so that your opponents can see clearly what your team contains!</p>
<h6>Hiring Players</h6>
<p>As with league play, players are the only compulsory element on a team drafted for exhibition play. Each team roster details all of the players available to a team of that type and their Hiring Fee. When drafting a team, you should select the players you want to permanently hire for your team, pay their hiring cost from the Team Draft Budget and make a record of the player on the Team Draft list.</p>
<p>As usual, a team may not include more players of a certain type than are allowed by the team roster.</p>
<h6>Purchasing Team Re-rolls</h6>
<p>Any team drafted for exhibition play can purchase team re-rolls, just like a team drafted for league play. Every team may buy 0-8 team re-rolls when it is drafted, for the cost shown on the team roster, paid for from the Team Draft Budget.</p>
<h6>Hiring Sideline Staff</h6>
<p>Sideline Staff can be of as much use to a team drafted for exhibition play as they are during a league. A team drafted for exhibition play can purchase Sideline Staff from the Team Draft Budget.</p>
<h6>Dedicated Fans</h6>
<p>Unlike a team drafted for league play, a team drafted for exhibition play will have a Dedicated Fans characteristic of 0.</p>
<p>However, teams drafted for exhibition play can still improve this up to a maximum of 6, at a cost of 10,000 gold pieces per improvement, as described on <a href="#p35">page 35</a>. For example, an exhibition team may purchase a Dedicated Fans characteristic of 3 at a cost of 30,000 gold pieces.</p>

                                
            </div>
                    <div id="p102" class="page">
                <a href="#p102" class="page-number">#102</a>
                <h5>Inducements in Exhibition Play</h5>
<p>Because all of the gold pieces in the Team Draft Budget must be spent when drafting a team for exhibition play, it is most uncommon that teams will be of different values. Therefore, when a team is drafted for exhibition play, you may spend as much or as little of your Team Draft Budget as you wish on Inducements, provided your team contains the minimum of 11 players, not including Induced Star Players. Inducements purchased in this way should be recorded on the Team Draft list.</p>
<p>If two coaches are drafting teams for exhibition play between themselves, they should take a few minutes to discuss Inducements first. It is important to decide if there are any Inducements they feel should be included or any they would prefer to leave out.</p>
<p>Tournament organisers should decide which, if any, Inducements will be allowed and ensure this information is passed on to participants.</p>
<h5>Player Advancement in Exhibition Play</h5>
<p>Unlike games played in a league, exhibition games are not linked. Therefore players will not have the opportunity to earn and spend Star Player points in the same way. However, teams drafted for exhibition play should include more than just rookies – having a few players with an extra Skill or two makes for a more interesting game. To allow for this, exhibition teams are granted a number of SPP to distribute between players, meaning that some players can be given advancements when the team is drafted.</p>
<h6>Free SPP</h6>
<p>How many SPP coaches have to distribute between their players varies. For example, you could grant each team 36 SPP to spend on advancements; this is a fair number and allows a good selection of advancements across a team. However, this is only a guideline, and the number can be increased or decreased as desired. More SPP will enable more player advancements, fewer SPP will obviously allow for fewer player advancements.</p>
<p>If two coaches are drafting teams for exhibition play between themselves, they should take a few minutes to determine how many SPP they will have first. Tournament organisers should decide how many SPP participants will have and ensure this information is passed on to participants.</p>
<h6>Spending SPP</h6>
<p>The first thing to bear in mind when drafting a team for exhibition play is that randomly selected Skills or characteristic improvements are perhaps best avoided. This is especially true in tournament play. Randomly selecting Skills or characteristic improvements ahead of each round can slow proceedings down quite a lot.</p>
<p>This leaves coaches with the option to choose Primary or Secondary skills for some of their players. How coaches distribute SPP between players is up to them. It is just as acceptable to create one superstar player with several new Skills as it is to distribute SPP evenly between a number of players. How many advancements a single player can be given should be discussed between coaches or decided by tournament organisers. Any SPP that are not spent are lost.</p>
<p>For example, if a coach has 36 SPP to spend they may choose to distribute them evenly, giving six players a Primary skill, or giving four players a Primary skill and one player a Secondary skill. Alternatively, all of the SPP could be spent on one player.</p>
<h6>VALUE INCREASE</h6>
<p>In league play, a player's value will increase as they spend SPP and gain advancements. However, for simplicity, this is not the case when drafting a team for exhibition play. No matter how many advancements a player is given, their value does not increase.</p>
<p>In other words, coaches do not have to worry about covering the cost of any additional Skills or characteristic increases players are given with gold pieces from their Team Draft Budget. Such advancements do not increase a player's value in exhibition play.</p>

                                
            </div>
                    <div id="p103" class="page">
                <a href="#p103" class="page-number">#103</a>
                <h5>Casualty Rolls</h5>
<p>In league play, as well as earning SPP and gaining advancements, players can pick up lasting injuries from the Casualty table that will dog their careers. In exhibition play this does not happen. Every time a team drafted for exhibition play takes to the pitch, it does so with a full complement of healthy, uninjured players. Any Casualty rolls made against a player in one game are forgotten about should the same team be used again later. This is of particular importance for Blood Bowl tournaments, where coaches will use the same team in several games over one or more days.</p>
<p>This, of course, is not to say that Casualty rolls do not matter in exhibition play. Casualty rolls should be made as normal. This is because not only do apothecaries work as normal in exhibition play, but several teams (notably teams with the Masters of Undeath or Favoured of Nurgle special rules) have the chance to gain an extra Lineman for the remainder of the game.</p>
<h5>The Prayers to Nuffle Table in Exhibition Play</h5>
<p>In league play, the Prayers to Nuffle table fulfils a vital role, used as it is during the pre-game sequence to help balance the value of both teams. Obviously, that isn't a concern during exhibition play due to the way teams are drafted. However, the Cheering Fans Kick-off event table result means that the Prayers to Nuffle table may still used. Some of the results are clearly tailored towards league play, particularly those that generate extra SPP. Therefore, during exhibition play, coaches should use the following, shortened version of the Prayers to Nuffle table for Cheering Fans:</p>

                <h2>The Teams</h2>
<p>From diminutive Halflings to huge hulking Ogres, from elegant and graceful Elves to lumbering and brutal Orcs – Blood Bowl players come in all shapes and sizes. These players represent a great many races and nations from all over the known world, which form up into an even greater number of teams of different types. From fresh-faced rookie squads, to famous franchises established decades ago, the number of teams playing the game today is higher than at any time in history. Teams travel far and wide searching for fame and glory. Some will make it. Most will be forgotten, a footnote on the sports trivia encyclopedias of history.</p>

                <h3>Blood Bowl Teams</h3>
<p>This section contains the rosters used to draft a rookie Blood Bowl team of your own for use in league play. It explains the special rules of different types that all teams have, detailing the advantages and disadvantages these bring to a team. Finally, it also briefly explains 'tiers', a method used to give an idea of the relative strengths and weaknesses of rookie Blood Bowl teams.</p>
<h4>Special Rules</h4>
<p>Most Blood Bowl teams are, despite appearances, quite straightforward in their behaviour and approach to the great game. Others are not. Be they the reanimated dead, devotees of the Dark Gods or corrupt Greenskins, many teams differ somewhat from the norm.</p>
<p>Special rules to help represent the different nuances of races and teams fall into two categories: the first, 'Regional' special rules, are named after famous leagues or competitions, and these are attached to teams that traditionally play in those leagues. Their purpose is to make it easy to determine which Inducements a team can or cannot take, thus simplifying the almost impenetrably complicated rules and regulations of the NAF.</p>
<p>The second category, 'Team' special rules, contains more complex rules. These deal with a unique characteristic of the team, something that sets it apart from others. These special rules grant the team certain benefits not enjoyed by other teams.</p>
<h5>Regional Special Rules</h5>
<p>As noted in their description, some Inducements are available only to teams with one of the following special rules. Other Inducements may be available for a reduced rate to teams with one of the following special rules. All teams have one or more of the following special rules:</p>

    <details id="special-rule-Badlands-Brawl" class="special-rule">

        <h3 class="heading-5">
            Badlands Brawl
            <small>(Regional)</small>
        </h3>
    </summary>
    <div>
        <p>The Badlands Brawl is home to a great many Greenskin and Ogre teams. Unsurprisingly, Blood Bowl in the Badlands is a brutal, violent and extremely dishonest affair, but these are virtues that make it ever popular with the fans!</p>

        <p>Played on high peaks under clear skies, the Superleague is the pride of the Dwarfen realm. Games last many hours as rules are carefully checked and checked again, ensuring that the purity of Roze-El’s sacred work is maintained. Interestingly, in Dwarfish ‘venerable’ and ‘dull’ are spelled the same.</p>

<p>Some teams may have one or more of the following special rules. These detail unique characteristics that set the team apart from others, be it the ability to reanimate the dead or the blessings of a patron Chaos deity.</p>
<p>Some teams may have one or more of the following special rules:</p>

    <div>
        <p>Many teams are legendarily unscrupulous. Such teams
excel in violence and dirty play. What’s more, they’re
not afraid to exert their influence on officials, either by
extortion or blackmail, encouraging them to turn a blind
eye to even the most illegal of illegal procedures!</p>
<p>It takes a strong-willed referee indeed to risk making
an enemy of a team so renowned for reacting… poorly
towards any official that would rebuke its behaviour:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once per game, when rolling on the Argue the Call
table, you may re-roll a roll of a natural 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a team with this special rule can
purchase certain Inducements for a reduced price, as
noted in the description of that Inducement.</p>

        <p>The followers of the Ruinous Powers are drawn to Blood Bowl, paying homage to their dark gods through violence on the pitch. Whilst many teams worship Chaos as a pantheon, many more dedicate their souls entirely to a single patron deity.</p>
<p>Certain Inducements are only available to teams that are ‘Favoured of’ a specific Chaos power, as noted in their description. A team may be noted as being either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Favoured of Chaos Undivided</li>
<li>Favoured of Khorne</li>
<li>Favoured of Nurgle</li>
<li>Favoured of Tzeentch</li>
<li>Favoured of Slaanesh</li>
<li>Favoured of Hashut</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, however, you may be able to choose the team’s alignment when the team is first drafted, as in the case of Chaos Renegades.</p>
<p>A team with this special rule cannot change its alignment.</p>

<li>In league play (but not in exhibition play), when calculating the Current Value of any permanently hired Lineman players on a team with this special rule, the Hiring Fee of that player is not included.</li>

    <div>
        <p>Teams with this special rule all fall into the broader
category of ‘Undead’. Usually created from the animated
corpses of freshly-deceased players brought back
to the game by athletically-inclined necromancers,
such teams don’t always operate quite like their more
vital counterparts!</p>
<p>The Head Coach of this team is replaced by a
Necromancer. Once per game, they can ‘Raise the Dead’:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a player on the opposing team with a Strength
characteristic of 4 or less and that does not have the
Regeneration or Stunty traits suffers a Casualty result
of 15-16, DEAD, and if they cannot be saved by an
apothecary, a new rookie Zombie Lineman player can
be placed immediately in the Reserves box of this
team’s dugout. Note that this may cause the team
to have more than 16 players for the remainder of
the game.</li>
<li>During Step 4 of the post-game sequence, this player
may be permanently hired for free if the team has
fewer than 16 players on its Team Draft list, otherwise
it will be lost. The player’s full value still counts towards
the Team Value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, just like the Head Coach of any other
team, a Necromancer can Argue the Call when one of
their players is Sent-off for committing a Foul, as long as
they haven’t been sent off themselves.</p>

                <h3>Team Tiers</h3>
<p>Not all teams are created equal. Some rookie teams are more challenging to coach than others, either because of the way in which players and their different skills interact, or because background-wise they would struggle to win (after all, what chance would a Halfling team really have against a Dark Elf team?). This is entirely intentional, and over the years a great many experienced coaches have savoured the challenge of playing to win with the teams that might be considered quite unlikely to be victorious!</p>
<p>All teams belong to one of three tiers, as detailed on their Team roster:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tier 1 is occupied by the strongest and most forgiving of teams, those that can easily recover from mistakes and mishaps.</li>
    <li>Tier 2 consists of those teams that often require a bit more experience on the part of the coach to excel. They are all highly competitive teams, but often a small mistake can prove costly!</li>
    <li>Tier 3, otherwise known as the 'Stunty teams', is home to the most difficult of teams to master. Halfling, Goblins and more, such teams are often victim to a hard time from bigger, tougher players, but they can still perform well in the hands of an experienced coach. To anyone who wants a real challenge but a truly entertaining game, Stunty teams are it!</li>
</ul>

        <h3 class="heading-5">Black Orc Team</h3>
    </summary>
    <div>
        <p>Black Orcs are the biggest and strongest of all Orcs. Many believe they draw their name from their dark green skin, although the title is more likely derived from their dour demeanour and bleak sense of humour! Grim and singularly focused on violence, it’s no wonder so many flock to the Blood Bowl pitch! Black Orcs treat other Greenskins as little more than frivolous amateurs, largely because lesser Orcs are likely to squabble amongst themselves and focus too much on beating up the opposition, instead of concentrating on the game. Consequently, many Black Orcs refuse to play alongside other Orcs, choosing instead to form their own teams. Yet Black Orcs aren’t stupid – they know the importance of speed and agility. As a result, Black Orc teams make great use of Goblins, many of whom they become quite fond of, treating them as favourite pets and training them to be tough with regular clumps about the noggin!</p>

        <p>Blood Bowl is arguably even more popular among the followers of the Chaos gods than it is among civilised folk. Maybe it’s the cult-like supporters’ clubs, the constant violence both on and off the pitch, or just the brightly-coloured strips... Whatever the case, wherever you find a Blood Bowl stadium, you’re guaranteed to find at least one team made up of an assortment of thoroughly debased, dedicated followers of Chaos. Most of the teams’ players tend to be Beastmen, hideous mutants who have given up their forest lairs for the sporting life, but their numbers are bolstered by the presence of superhuman Chosen, and frenzied and blood-crazed Minotaurs, Ogres and Trolls. Such teams are hardly subtle, often forgetting about the ball entirely as they grind their opponents into the turf, all in veneration of the Ruinous Powers they worship.</p>

    </summary>
    <div>
        <p>Chaos Renegade teams represent the real flotsam and jetsam of the Blood Bowl world, players so maladjusted that no coach worth their salt would let them play on their roster. They might be bitter rejects, inveterate cheats or blatant foulers. Many are outcasts expelled from established teams. Inevitably, such players end up rejecting the ways of Nuffle and dedicating themselves to other dark powers, often garnering themselves all manner of dubious mutations as ‘rewards’ in the process. The most successful team of this type was the Chaos All-Stars, whose eccentrically mixed line-up managed to soar to glory. Also of note is the (in)famous Mongrel Horde, a motley assortment of scumbags in it for the gold. Unfortunately, most of the Horde’s players hate each other, often refusing to play nicely or turn up to practices together!</p>

        <p>Thousands of years ago, the Dark Elves were little more than a small group within High Elf society who turned their back on traditional Elven ways. They eschewed nobility and grace for power and glory, believing their immortality marked them out as the most powerful of all the world’s races. Their thirst for conquest led to a bitter civil war that rocked the Elven kingdoms. Dark Elf teams exhibit similar strengths and weaknesses to their Elven cousins, but are distinctly more aggressive in their game. But sheer spite makes the Dark Elves enjoy the running game, particularly when a team includes a remarkable player like Jeremiah Kool. In fact, it is hard to believe that the Flashing Blade won’t be tempted out of retirement – if not by the Darkside Cowboys, then by some other team.</p>

        <p>Dwarfs were one of the very first races to play Blood Bowl and many Dwarf teams can trace their history to the early years of the game. Dwarfs tend to use a running game, grinding their opponents into the ground as they go and working on the principle of high casualty rates opening up the field. There are so many Dwarf teams around that it is possible to find one to champion almost any style of play. It is, however, the Dwarfs’ reputation for flamboyant illegality that makes them such a big hit with the fans. Since it was a Dwarf, now immortalised by the name Roze-El, who first translated Nuffle’s sacred laws and brought the game into being, most Dwarf teams believe they have a lasting right to alter the laws as they choose.</p>

    </summary>
    <div>
        <p>Following the collapse of the NAF, many Elven teams found themselves indebted to noble backers from the Elven kingdoms, who – thanks to a lot of small print – began to make their way onto the pitch, shunting established players to the sidelines. Outrage abounded among players and fans alike, and it was only a matter of time before something was done about it. When that something finally happened, the formation of the Elven Union came as a surprise to no one. A loose federation of Elven teams, made up primarily of High Elf players but including the odd Wood Elf and even Dark Elf, the Union seeks to repair the damaged reputation of Elven teams and show that they can take Blood Bowl seriously. What the teams lack in funding, they make up for with experience and stubborn determination.</p>

        <p>Goblins are cruel and uncouth, with a juvenile sense of humour and a wicked imagination dedicated to discovering new ways of hurting others without getting hurt themselves. This tends to make them better Blood Bowl fans than players, and indeed Goblin fans have a solid reputation throughout the Old World for turning up hours before the game, getting drunk, starting fights, singing lewd and insulting songs, and generally causing trouble wherever they go. Unsurprisingly, Goblin teams don’t tend to do amazingly well on the pitch, but by Nuffle are they entertaining! Their play style revolves around a seemingly endless arsenal of ‘secret’ weapons which the Gobbos sneak onto the pitch at every opportunity, and the assistance of lumbering Trolls who alternate between flinging their smaller team-mates up the pitch and absent-mindedly chewing on them instead!</p>

        <p>The technical deficiency of Halfling teams is legendary. They’re too short to throw or catch, they run at half pace, and it goes without saying that their blocking game leaves something to be desired. Most Halfling coaches, aware of the material that they have to work with, make up for quality with quantity. After all, if you can get half a dozen players in the opposing team’s End Zone and, by some miracle, manage to end up with the ball, then there is a small chance that one or two of them won’t be jelly by the time you throw the thing! Probably the only real point in the Halflings’ favour is their long-held alliance with the Treemen who guard the forests of their realm, and a team that can tempt one (or two!) of them along to a game suddenly doesn’t look so pathetic!</p>

        <p>Professional Human players are widely considered to be the best all-round Blood Bowl players in the Old World. What they may lack in the sheer strength of the Orcs, the agility of the High Elves, the toughness of the Dwarfs, the frenzy of the Dark Elves, or the speed of the Skaven, they make up for in sheer grit and determination! More importantly, they do not suffer the weaknesses commonly associated with any of these players. For example, where Dwarfs are tough, they are also slow, Humans by contrast are hardy and relatively quick, and whilst Skaven are very quick, they are not as brave as Humans. It is hardly surprising then that Humans account for over half of all Blood Bowl players – counting Skeletons, Ghouls and Vampires playing for Undead teams, and mutants playing for Chaos teams!</p>

        <p>It is quite the norm that Blood Bowl teams are privately owned, but where the majority of teams are owned by proprietors and coaches who run their teams as professional outfits, there are plenty of other teams that exist for other reasons. Rich nobles, eager entrepreneurs, crime lords with large sums of cash to hide from treasury men who ask bothersome questions, all these and more are drawn to the sport. Some are lured by the presence of vast wealth and long to liberate it from its current owners and keep it safe with their existing fortunes. Others are eager fans to whom the idea of owning a famous Blood Bowl team is a fantasy they can afford to pursue. Some such fortunate fans take it a step further and build teams to live out their dreams of becoming famous players themselves!</p>

        <p>If Blood Bowl historians are to be believed, Lizardmen have been playing the sport for over 8000 years. This does seem a little unlikely but when questioned, Blood Bowl historians just nod smugly, peer over their spectacles and say that this just goes to show how prescient Lizardmen are. Whatever the story behind their involvement in the sport, they’ve definitely made an impact! On the field, Lizardmen epitomise teamwork, with up to four different species working together on the pitch at a time. Skinks are the most numerous players, highly agile and as quick as lightning. They are balanced out by Saurus, fewer in number and not as fast, but capable of dishing out some serious punishment. Then there are the Kroxigor, reptilian monstrosities capable of felling an Ogre with a single blow!</p>

        <p>The dead do not rest easy. From haunted castles to sinister forests, Undead creatures prowl the night, snatching unwary villagers from their beds. Well, some of them do. For the rest, there’s Blood Bowl! Many Necromancers, proficient at corpse-raising and flesh-crafting but lacking a real plan of how to use their skills, realise that warm dugouts are a lovely alternative to musty tombs and dank barrows, and therefore decide to assemble a team of players (quite literally!). Interestingly, a schism of sorts seems to have occurred, leading to two competing philosophies when it comes to coaching an Undead team. Some Necromancers put their trust in the ancient dead. Other Necromancers prefer a little more life in their team, buying the services of Werewolves with promises of fresh meat and stitching together hulking Flesh Golems from an assortment of cadavers.</p>

        <p>The followers of Chaos have been involved in Blood Bowl since the earliest days of the sport. Although most teams started as a conglomerate of followers of all of the Chaos gods, it didn’t take long for teams to be more selective in their choice of deity. On the field, Nurgle teams are a terrifying prospect to face. What they lack in agility and coordination, they more than make up for with brute strength, a natural resilience to harm and a whole playbook of stomach-churning tactics devised to bring the other team to its knees. Nurgle teams defy conventional definition, being made up of Rotters, players who have contracted one or more of Nurgle’s many blessings; Bloaters, players swollen with disease; Pestigors, Beastmen attracted to the smell; and Rotspawn, players so blessed by the Plague God that they have devolved into hideously mutated beasts.</p>

        <p>At face value, the thought of an Ogre Blood Bowl team is enough to fill most players with dread. Thankfully, the reality never quite lives up to their worst fears. For starters, most Ogres are incredibly dense. Just getting them to all turn up at the same time is a mammoth task. Not to mention that very few coaches can afford to field more than a few Ogres at a time, meaning that most Ogre teams are bulked out with Gnoblars. Then there’s the fact that, no matter how much you train them, the moment the whistle goes, most Ogres forget everything and try to pound their opponents into a bloody mess. Coaches who know what they’re doing can turn this to their advantage, but it’s a rare sight to see an Ogre team performing consistently.</p>

        <p>The cities of the Old World are bustling metropoles, populated by all manner of different races. From Kislev in the cold north, to Estalia in the sweltering south, Humans build their homes, and to these flock Dwarfs, Halflings and more. Many Dwarfs come to build the tall towers and maintain the high walls of these great cities, whilst Halflings come to cook, eat and steal any small items they happen upon. Indeed, in these more enlightened times when warfare is considered a thing of the past, ever more varied races flock to these urban centres, so that today even Ogres are an increasingly common sight. Old World Alliance teams, though relatively uncommon, tend to form in the largest of cities, where cosmopolitan players of various races are drawn together to enjoy Nuffle’s great game.</p>

        <p>Orcs have been playing Blood Bowl since the game was discovered – in fact it was an Orc who found the shrine where the sacred Tome of Nuffle was hidden. Orc teams are very hard-hitting, concentrating on pounding the opposition into the turf to create gaps through which Orc Blitzers can run. Indeed, if any fault can be found with Orc teams, it is that if they aren’t fighting amongst themselves, they’re spending too much time beating up the other team! Orcs have always respected brawn over intelligence, so their line of scrimmage is often overloaded with Big Uns and Troll players, adding even more weight to the front line. The Orc race also has close ties with other Greenskin races such as Goblins, and it is common to find such players in Orc teams.</p>

    <div>
        <p>The first Shambling Undead teams took to the gridiron a mere half century ago, and it has taken much of that time for the Undead to become accepted by the establishment. Today, they are a popular sight on the pitch. Fans love to see the reanimated dead shambling about, oblivious to all but the most debilitating of injuries, even as they dish out punishment to the opposition! Be it dry as dust Skeletons, their marionette movements mocking the living, or fresh Zombies, their moans and groans echoing around the pitch, accompanied by the fans' laughter at their awkward and stilted movements. Or from enraged Mummies, their unearthly roars of anger setting pulses racing, to sinister Ghouls stalking the wide zones, eyeing the crowds hungrily, Undead teams are a feast of sensations for eager fans!</p>

        <p>The game of Blood Bowl has become very popular in all walks of Skaven life. True to their warped nature, the Skaven have adapted the game in their own special ways. A new clan has been formed to govern and control the game – Clan Rigens – which consists of over 20 teams. The most famous are the Skavenblight Scramblers, twice winners of the Blood Bowl trophy. Several other teams have achieved successes in other, lesser leagues and competitions too, and there are mixed teams with a large proportion of Skaven competing at various levels. Of course, their close association with warpstone and the resulting mutations have helped with this success, but even the basic Skaven player has a lot going for them. It’s only a matter of time before a Skaven team makes it to the top again!</p>

        <p>Snotlings are the smallest, and perhaps the most numerous, type of Greenskin in the world. Tiny in stature and severely lacking any sense of self-preservation, they are enthusiastic followers and players of Blood Bowl. They sometimes appear in Ogre teams, but Snotlings are often unwilling to take to the field alongside other races, believing as they so often do in self-perpetuating myths of their own superiority. Such Snotlings swarm together around a visionary coach in great numbers and take to the pitch in a frenzy of enthusiasm. Officials hate to see Snotling teams, for various reasons, chief amongst which is that Snotlings can’t (or, more correctly, won’t) count and their ridiculously tiny stature makes them nigh impossible to manage as they flood onto the pitch!</p>

        <p>Ask any Goblinoid and they’ll tell you that it’s not easy being a low-down sneaky git! Similarly, if you managed to corner a Skaven long enough to get an answer out of them, they’d probably tell you that living in the sewers is less fun than it looks. It’s not entirely clear when these very different races first joined forces, but there’s a good chance that the Underworld Creepers were the first such team to take to the pitch. Fuelled by a heady elixir of warpstone- infused mushrooms, Underworld Denizens teams combine the sneakiness of Snotlings and Goblins with the speed of Skaven; most are despised, but some of them have garnered a cult following! The most popular tend to be those who field a Troll or Rat Ogre, hideous and pallid mountains of slab-like muscle that serve as enforcers for their smaller team-mates.</p>

        <p>Wood Elves make natural Blood Bowl players, although their refusal to wear heavy armour does leave them vulnerable to some of the more hard hitting teams. Generally, the Wood Elves’ natural athletic ability is enough to keep them out of trouble – it takes a fast or cunning foe to catch a Wood Elf player. In any case, no decent Wood Elf wants to wear bulky, shapeless armour, let alone be seen in it! For Wood Elves the long pass is everything, even more so than for their High Elf cousins, and all of their effort goes into becoming experts at throwing or receiving. The one exception to this is the Wood Elf Wardancers. These athletic warriors are trained in the deadly arts of hand-to-hand combat and are a match for almost any foe.</p>
