        description: 'Black Orcs are the biggest and strongest of all Orcs. Many believe they draw their name from their dark green skin, although the title is more likely derived from their dour demeanour and bleak sense of humour! Grim and singularly focused on violence, it’s no wonder so many flock to the Blood Bowl pitch! Black Orcs treat other Greenskins as little more than frivolous amateurs, largely because lesser Orcs are likely to squabble amongst themselves and focus too much on beating up the opposition, instead of concentrating on the game. Consequently, many Black Orcs refuse to play alongside other Orcs, choosing instead to form their own teams. Yet Black Orcs aren’t stupid – they know the importance of speed and agility. As a result, Black Orc teams make great use of Goblins, many of whom they become quite fond of, treating them as favourite pets and training them to be tough with regular clumps about the noggin!'

Maybe it’s the cult-like supporters’ clubs, the constant violence both on and off the pitch, or just the brightly-coloured strips... Whatever the case, wherever you find a Blood Bowl stadium, you’re guaranteed to find at least one team made up of an assortment of thoroughly debased, dedicated followers of Chaos. Most of the teams’ players tend to be Beastmen, hideous mutants who have given up their forest lairs for the sporting life, but their numbers are bolstered by the presence of superhuman Chosen, and frenzied and blood-crazed Minotaurs, Ogres and Trolls. Such teams are hardly subtle, often forgetting about the ball entirely as they grind their opponents into the turf, all in veneration of the Ruinous Powers they worship.'

Inevitably, such players end up rejecting the ways of Nuffle and dedicating themselves to other dark powers, often garnering themselves all manner of dubious mutations as ‘rewards’ in the process. The most successful team of this type was the Chaos All-Stars, whose eccentrically mixed line-up managed to soar to glory. Also of note is the (in)famous Mongrel Horde, a motley assortment of scumbags in it for the gold. Unfortunately, most of the Horde’s players hate each other, often refusing to play nicely or turn up to practices together!'

        name: 'Dark Elf'
        description: 'Thousands of years ago, the Dark Elves were little more than a small group within High Elf society who turned their back on traditional Elven ways. They eschewed nobility and grace for power and glory, believing their immortality marked them out as the most powerful of all the world’s races. Their thirst for conquest led to a bitter civil war that rocked the Elven kingdoms. Dark Elf teams exhibit similar strengths and weaknesses to their Elven cousins, but are distinctly more aggressive in their game. But sheer spite makes the Dark Elves enjoy the running game, particularly when a team includes a remarkable player like Jeremiah Kool. In fact, it is hard to believe that the Flashing Blade won’t be tempted out of retirement – if not by the Darkside Cowboys, then by some other team.'

    Dwarf:
        name: Dwarf
        description: 'Dwarfs were one of the very first races to play Blood Bowl and many Dwarf teams can trace their history to the early years of the game. Dwarfs tend to use a running game, grinding their opponents into the ground as they go and working on the principle of high casualty rates opening up the field. There are so many Dwarf teams around that it is possible to find one to champion almost any style of play. It is, however, the Dwarfs’ reputation for flamboyant illegality that makes them such a big hit with the fans. Since it was a Dwarf, now immortalised by the name Roze-El, who first translated Nuffle’s sacred laws and brought the game into being, most Dwarf teams believe they have a lasting right to alter the laws as they choose.'

        description: 'Following the collapse of the NAF, many Elven teams found themselves indebted to noble backers from the Elven kingdoms, who – thanks to a lot of small print – began to make their way onto the pitch, shunting established players to the sidelines. Outrage abounded among players and fans alike, and it was only a matter of time before something was done about it. When that something finally happened, the formation of the Elven Union came as a surprise to no one. A loose federation of Elven teams, made up primarily of High Elf players but including the odd Wood Elf and even Dark Elf, the Union seeks to repair the damaged reputation of Elven teams and show that they can take Blood Bowl seriously. What the teams lack in funding, they make up for with experience and stubborn determination.'

Unsurprisingly, Goblin teams don’t tend to do amazingly well on the pitch, but by Nuffle are they entertaining! Their play style revolves around a seemingly endless arsenal of ‘secret’ weapons which the Gobbos sneak onto the pitch at every opportunity, and the assistance of lumbering Trolls who alternate between flinging their smaller team-mates up the pitch and absent-mindedly chewing on them instead!'

They’re too short to throw or catch, they run at half pace, and it goes without saying that their blocking game leaves something to be desired. Most Halfling coaches, aware of the material that they have to work with, make up for quality with quantity. After all, if you can get half a dozen players in the opposing team’s End Zone and, by some miracle, manage to end up with the ball, then there is a small chance that one or two of them won’t be jelly by the time you throw the thing! Probably the only real point in the Halflings’ favour is their long-held alliance with the Treemen who guard the forests of their realm, and a team that can tempt one (or two!) of them along to a game suddenly doesn’t look so pathetic!'

They have many advantages when it comes to winning (as opposed to slaughtering the opposition, which isn’t always the same thing…), and their fine players are the epitome of the more graceful side of the game. The only real problem with High Elf teams is that they can be very picky about who, when or where they play, so we must be thankful they deign to play lesser races at all!'

    Human:
        name: Human
        description: 'Professional Human players are widely considered to be the best all-round Blood Bowl players in the Old World. What they may lack in the sheer strength of the Orcs, the agility of the High Elves, the toughness of the Dwarfs, the frenzy of the Dark Elves, or the speed of the Skaven, they make up for in sheer grit and determination! More importantly, they do not suffer the weaknesses commonly associated with any of these players. For example, where Dwarfs are tough, they are also slow, Humans by contrast are hardy and relatively quick, and whilst Skaven are very quick, they are not as brave as Humans. It is hardly surprising then that Humans account for over half of all Blood Bowl players – counting Skeletons, Ghouls and Vampires playing for Undead teams, and mutants playing for Chaos teams!'

Whatever the story behind their involvement in the sport, they’ve definitely made an impact! On the field, Lizardmen epitomise teamwork, with up to four different species working together on the pitch at a time. Skinks are the most numerous players, highly agile and as quick as lightning. They are balanced out by Saurus, fewer in number and not as fast, but capable of dishing out some serious punishment. Then there are the Kroxigor, reptilian monstrosities capable of felling an Ogre with a single blow!'

Interestingly, a schism of sorts seems to have occurred, leading to two competing philosophies when it comes to coaching an Undead team. Some Necromancers put their trust in the ancient dead. Other Necromancers prefer a little more life in their team, buying the services of Werewolves with promises of fresh meat and stitching together hulking Flesh Golems from an assortment of cadavers.'

        description: 'The followers of Chaos have been involved in Blood Bowl since the earliest days of the sport. Although most teams started as a conglomerate of followers of all of the Chaos gods, it didn’t take long for teams to be more selective in their choice of deity. On the field, Nurgle teams are a terrifying prospect to face. What they lack in agility and coordination, they more than make up for with brute strength, a natural resilience to harm and a whole playbook of stomach-churning tactics devised to bring the other team to its knees. Nurgle teams defy conventional definition, being made up of Rotters, players who have contracted one or more of Nurgle’s many blessings; Bloaters, players swollen with disease; Pestigors, Beastmen attracted to the smell; and Rotspawn, players so blessed by the Plague God that they have devolved into hideously mutated beasts.'

        description: 'At face value, the thought of an Ogre Blood Bowl team is enough to fill most players with dread. Thankfully, the reality never quite lives up to their worst fears. For starters, most Ogres are incredibly dense. Just getting them to all turn up at the same time is a mammoth task. Not to mention that very few coaches can afford to field more than a few Ogres at a time, meaning that most Ogre teams are bulked out with Gnoblars. Then there’s the fact that, no matter how much you train them, the moment the whistle goes, most Ogres forget everything and try to pound their opponents into a bloody mess. Coaches who know what they’re doing can turn this to their advantage, but it’s a rare sight to see an Ogre team performing consistently.'

Many Dwarfs come to build the tall towers and maintain the high walls of these great cities, whilst Halflings come to cook, eat and steal any small items they happen upon. Indeed, in these more enlightened times when warfare is considered a thing of the past, ever more varied races flock to these urban centres, so that today even Ogres are an increasingly common sight. Old World Alliance teams, though relatively uncommon, tend to form in the largest of cities, where cosmopolitan players of various races are drawn together to enjoy Nuffle’s great game.'

Orc teams are very hard-hitting, concentrating on pounding the opposition into the turf to create gaps through which Orc Blitzers can run. Indeed, if any fault can be found with Orc teams, it is that if they aren’t fighting amongst themselves, they’re spending too much time beating up the other team! Orcs have always respected brawn over intelligence, so their line of scrimmage is often overloaded with Big Uns and Troll players, adding even more weight to the front line. The Orc race also has close ties with other Greenskin races such as Goblins, and it is common to find such players in Orc teams.'

        description: 'The game of Blood Bowl has become very popular in all walks of Skaven life. True to their warped nature, the Skaven have adapted the game in their own special ways. A new clan has been formed to govern and control the game – Clan Rigens – which consists of over 20 teams. The most famous are the Skavenblight Scramblers, twice winners of the Blood Bowl trophy. Several other teams have achieved successes in other, lesser leagues and competitions too, and there are mixed teams with a large proportion of Skaven competing at various levels. Of course, their close association with warpstone and the resulting mutations have helped with this success, but even the basic Skaven player has a lot going for them. It’s only a matter of time before a Skaven team makes it to the top again!'

Tiny in stature and severely lacking any sense of self-preservation, they are enthusiastic followers and players of Blood Bowl. They sometimes appear in Ogre teams, but Snotlings are often unwilling to take to the field alongside other races, believing as they so often do in self-perpetuating myths of their own superiority. Such Snotlings swarm together around a visionary coach in great numbers and take to the pitch in a frenzy of enthusiasm. Officials hate to see Snotling teams, for various reasons, chief amongst which is that Snotlings can’t (or, more correctly, won’t) count and their ridiculously tiny stature makes them nigh impossible to manage as they flood onto the pitch!'

Each team is led by a liche priest, an ancient wizard who holds the team together, quite literally, as well as fulfilling all the normal roles you’d expect from a head coach. The team itself is mostly made up of the Skeletons of long-dead players who were sealed into the tombs alongside their deceased sponsors in millennia past, fulfilling the terms of their eternal contracts, rounded out with mighty Tomb Guardians, dauntless revenants who are an utter terror in the midfield.'

It’s not entirely clear when these very different races first joined forces, but there’s a good chance that the Underworld Creepers were the first such team to take to the pitch. Fuelled by a heady elixir of warpstone- infused mushrooms, Underworld Denizens teams combine the sneakiness of Snotlings and Goblins with the speed of Skaven; most are despised, but some of them have garnered a cult following! The most popular tend to be those who field a Troll or Rat Ogre, hideous and pallid mountains of slab-like muscle that serve as enforcers for their smaller team-mates.'

        ruleBookDescription: |
            When this player is activated, the only action they may perform is a ‘Ball & Chain Move’ Special action. There is no limit to how many players with this Trait may perform this Special action each team turn.

            When this player performs this Special action:

            * Place the Throw-in template over the player, facing towards either End Zone or either sideline as you wish.
            * Roll a D6 and move the player one square in the direction indicated.
            * A player with a Ball & Chain automatically passes any Agility tests they may be required to make in order to Dodge, regardless of any modifiers.
            * If this movement takes the player off the pitch, they risk Injury by the Crowd.
            * If this movement takes the player into a square in which the ball is placed, the player is considered to have moved involuntarily. Therefore, they may not attempt to pick the ball up and the ball will bounce.

            Repeat this process for each square the player moves.

            If this player would move into a square that is occupied by a Standing player from either team, they must perform a Block action against that player, following the normal rules, but with the following exceptions:

            * A Ball & Chain player ignores the Foul Appearance skill.
            * A Ball & Chain player must follow-up if they push-back another player.

            If this player moves into a square that is occupied by a Prone or Stunned player from either team, for any reason, that player is immediately pushed back and an Armour roll is made against them.

            This player may Rush. Declare that the player will Rush before placing the Throw-in template and rolling the D6 to determine direction:

            * If this player Rushes into an unoccupied square, move them as normal and roll a D6:
              - On a roll of 2+, this player moves without mishap.
              - On a roll of 1 (before or after modification), the player Falls Over.
            * If this player Rushes into a square that is occupied by a standing player from either team, roll a D6:
              - On a roll of 2+, this player moves without mishap and will perform a Block action against the player occupying the square as described previously.
              - On a roll of 1 (before or after modification), the player occupying the square is pushed back and this player will Fall Over after moving into the vacated square.

            If this player ever Falls Over, is Knocked Down or is Placed Prone, an Injury roll is immediately made against them (no Armour roll is required), treating a Stunned result as a KO’d result.

            A player with this Trait cannot also have the Diving Tackle, Frenzy, Grab, Leap, Multiple Block, On the Ball or Shadowing skills.

This Special action is neither a Pass action nor a Throw Team-Mate action, so does not prevent another player performing one of those actions during the same team turn. However, only a single player with this Trait may perform this Special action each team turn.

            A Bomb can be thrown and caught, and the throw interfered with, just like a ball, using the rules for Pass actions as described on page 48, with the following exceptions:

            * A player may not stand up or move before performing a Throw Bomb action.
            * Bombs do not bounce and can come to rest on the ground in an occupied square. Should a player fail to catch a Bomb, it will come to rest on the ground in the square that player occupies.
            * If a Bomb is fumbled, it will explode immediately in the square occupied by the player attempting to throw it.
            * If a Bomb comes to rest on the ground in an empty square or is caught by an opposition player, no Turnover is caused.
            * A player that is in possession of the ball can still catch a Bomb.
            * Any Skills that can be used when performing a Pass action can also be used when performing a Throw Bomb Special action, with the exception of On the Ball.

            If a Bomb is caught by a player on either team, roll a D6:

            * On a roll of 4+, the Bomb explodes immediately, as described below.
            * On a roll of 1-3, that player must throw the Bomb again immediately. This throw takes place out of the normal sequence of play.

            Should a Bomb ever leave the pitch, it explodes in the crowd with no effect (on the game) before the crowd can throw it back.

            When a Bomb comes to rest on the ground, in either an unoccupied square, in a square occupied by a player that failed to catch the Bomb or in a square occupied by a Prone or Stunned player, it will explode immediately:

            * If the Bomb explodes in an occupied square, that player is automatically hit by the explosion.
            * Roll a D6 for each player (from either team) that occupies a square adjacent to the one in which the Bomb exploded:
              - On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the explosion.
              - On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the explosion.
            * Any Standing players hit by the explosion are Knocked Down.
            * An Armour roll (and possibly an Injury roll as well) is made against any player hit by the explosion, even if they were already Prone or Stunned.
            * You may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll.

            * On a roll of 2+, this player continues their activation as normal and completes their declared action.

            If you declared that this player would perform an action which can only be performed once per team turn and this player’s activation ended before the action could be completed, the action is considered to have been performed and no other player on your team may perform the same action this team turn.

            * On a roll of 1, the Chainsaw will violently ‘kick-back’ and hit the player wielding it.
            * In either case, an Armour roll is made against the player hit by the Chainsaw, adding +3 to the result.
            * If the armour of the player hit is broken, they become Prone and an Injury roll is made against them. This Injury roll cannot be modified in any way.
            * If the armour of the player hit is not broken, this Trait has no effect.

            This player can only use the Chainsaw once per turn(i.e., a Chainsaw cannot be used with Frenzy or Multiple Block) and if used as part of a Blitz action, this player cannot continue moving after using it.

            If this player Falls Over or is Knocked Down, the opposing coach may add +3 to the Armour roll made against the player.

            If an opposition player performs a Block action targeting this player and a Player Down! or a POW! result is applied, +3 is added to the Armour roll. If a Both Down result is applied, +3 is added to both Armour rolls.

            Finally, this player may use their Chainsaw when they perform a Foul action. Roll a D6 for kick-back as described above. Once again, an Armour roll is made against the player hit by the Chainsaw, adding +3 to the score.

Then make an Agility test for this player, applying a -1 modifier for every player (other than the nominated player) that is Marking this player. If the test is passed, the nominated player loses their Tackle Zone until they are next activated.

            This player may move before performing this Special action, following all of the normal movement rules. However, once this Special action has been performed, this player may not move further and their activation comes to an This player is jealous of and dislikes certain other players on their team, as shown in brackets after the name of the Skill on this player’s profile. This may be defined by position or race. For example, a Skaven Thrower on an Underworld Denizens team has Animosity (Underworld Goblin Linemen), meaning they suffer Animosity towards any Underworld Goblin Linemen players on their team. Whereas a Skaven Renegade on a Chaos Renegade team has Animosity (all team-mates), meaning they suffer Animosity towards all of their team-mates equally.

            When this player wishes to perform a Hand-off action to a team-mate of the type listed, or attempts to perform a Pass action and the target square is occupied by a team-mate of the type listed, this player may refuse to do so.

            To perform a Kick Team-Mate Special action, follow the rules for Throw Team-Mate actions as described on page 52.

            However, if the Kick Team-Mate Special action is fumbled, the kicked player is automatically removed from play and an Injury roll is made against them, treating a Stunned result as a KO’d result (note that, if the player that performed this action also has the Mighty Blow (+X) skill, the coach of the opposing team may use that Skill on this Injury roll). If the kicked player was in possession of the ball when removed from play, the ball will bounce from the square they occupied.

            * Place the Throw-in template over the player, facing towards either End Zone or either sideline as you wish.
            * Roll a D6 and move the player one square in the direction indicated.

            Repeat this process for each square the player moves.

            If this player would move into a square that is occupied by a Standing player from either team, they must perform a Block action against that player, following the normal rules, but with the following exceptions:

            * A Ball & Chain player ignores the Foul Appearance skill.

            If this player moves into a square that is occupied by a Prone or Stunned player from either team, for any reason, that player is immediately pushed back and an Armour roll is made against them.

            This player may Rush. Declare that the player will Rush before placing the Throw-in template and rolling the D6 to determine direction:

            * If this player Rushes into an unoccupied square, move them as normal and roll a D6:
                - On a roll of 2+, this player moves without mishap.
                - On a roll of 1 (before or after modification), the player Falls Over.
            * If this player Rushes into a square that is occupied by a standing player from either team, roll a D6:
                - On a roll of 2+, this player moves without mishap and will perform a Block action against the player occupying the square as described previously.
                - On a roll of 1 (before or after modification), the player occupying the square is pushed back and this player will Fall Over after moving into the vacated square.

            If this player ever Falls Over, is Knocked Down or is Placed Prone, an Injury roll is immediately made against them (no Armour roll is required), treating a Stunned result as a KO'd result.

            A player with this Trait cannot also have the Diving Tackle, Frenzy, Grab, Leap, Multiple Block, On the Ball or Shadowing skills.

                * In addition, a team with this special rule can purchase certain Inducements for a reduced price, as noted in the description of that Inducement.

            The followers of the Ruinous Powers are drawn to Blood Bowl, paying homage to their dark gods through violence on the pitch. Whilst many teams worship Chaos as a pantheon, many more dedicate their souls entirely to a single patron deity.

            Certain Inducements are only available to teams that are ‘Favoured of’ a specific Chaos power, as noted in their description. A team may be noted as being either:

            * Favoured of Chaos Undivided
            * Favoured of Khorne
            * Favoured of Nurgle
            * Favoured of Tzeentch
            * Favoured of Slaanesh
            * Favoured of Hashut

            In some cases, however, you may be able to choose the team’s alignment when the team is first drafted, as in the case of Chaos Renegades. A team with this special rule cannot change its alignment.

            Some teams field Linemen of great skill and ability. Other teams do not and will happily take on the most useless of players to fill out their ranks. Readily available, easily replaceable and usually willing to work for pennies, such players fill gaps in the rosters, but rarely do much more! Teams with this special rule are not very particular about the Linemen they hire. To make up for this, they don’t usually bother to pay them:

            * In league play (but not in exhibition play), when calculating the Current Value of any permanently hired Lineman players on a team with this special rule, the Hiring Fee of that player is not included.

Usually created from the animated corpses of freshly-deceased players brought back to the game by athletically-inclined necromancers, such teams don’t always operate quite like their more vital counterparts!'

            The Head Coach of this team is replaced by a Vampire Lord. Once per game, during the post-game sequence, they can 'Summon a Thrall':

            * If a player on the opposing team with a Strength characteristic of 4 or less and that did not have the Regeneration or Stunty traits suffered a Casualty result of 15 or 16, DEAD during the game, and if they could not be saved by an apothecary, during Step 4 of the post-game sequence a single new rookie Thrall Lineman player may be permanently hired for free if the team has fewer than 16 players on its team draft list, otherwise it will be lost. The Thrall Lineman's full value still counts towards the Team Value.

            Additionally, just like the Head Coach of any other team, a Vampire Lord can Argue the Call when one of their players is Sent-off for committing a Foul, as long as they haven't been Sent-off themselves.
