Black Orc,2,60000,TRUE,"Badlands Brawl, Bribery and Corruption","all_of=[Badlands Brawl, Bribery and Corruption]",,"Black Orcs are the biggest and strongest of all Orcs. Many believe they draw their name from their dark green skin, although the title is more likely derived from their dour demeanour and bleak sense of humour! Grim and singularly focused on violence, it’s no wonder so many flock to the Blood Bowl pitch! Black Orcs treat other Greenskins as little more than frivolous amateurs, largely because lesser Orcs are likely to squabble amongst themselves and focus too much on beating up the opposition, instead of concentrating on the game. Consequently, many Black Orcs refuse to play alongside other Orcs, choosing instead to form their own teams. Yet Black Orcs aren’t stupid – they know the importance of speed and agility. As a result, Black Orc teams make great use of Goblins, many of whom they become quite fond of, treating them as favourite pets and training them to be tough with regular clumps about the noggin!",BB2020
Chaos Chosen,2,60000,TRUE,"Favoured of… (choose either): Favoured of Chaos Undivided, Favoured of Khorne, Favoured of Nurgle, Favoured of Slaanesh, Favoured of Tzeentch, or Favoured of Hashut.","one_of=[Favoured of Chaos Undivided, Favoured of Khorne, Favoured of Nurgle, Favoured of Slaanesh, Favoured of Tzeentch, Favoured of Hashut]",,"Blood Bowl is arguably even more popular among the followers of the Chaos gods than it is among civilised folk. Maybe it’s the cult-like supporters’ clubs, the constant violence both on and off the pitch, or just the brightly-coloured strips... Whatever the case, wherever you find a Blood Bowl stadium, you’re guaranteed to find at least one team made up of an assortment of thoroughly debased, dedicated followers of Chaos. Most of the teams’ players tend to be Beastmen, hideous mutants who have given up their forest lairs for the sporting life, but their numbers are bolstered by the presence of superhuman Chosen, and frenzied and blood-crazed Minotaurs, Ogres and Trolls. Such teams are hardly subtle, often forgetting about the ball entirely as they grind their opponents into the turf, all in veneration of the Ruinous Powers they worship.",BB2020
Chaos Renegades,2,70000,TRUE,"Favoured of… (choose either): Favoured of Chaos Undivided, Favoured of Khorne, Favoured of Nurgle, Favoured of Slaanesh, Favoured of Tzeentch, or Favoured of Hashut.","one_of=[Favoured of Chaos Undivided, Favoured of Khorne, Favoured of Nurgle, Favoured of Slaanesh, Favoured of Tzeentch, Favoured of Hashut]","A Chaos Renegade team may include up to three Big Guys, chosen from among the following: Renegade Troll, Renegade Ogre, Renegade Minotaur, or Renegade Rat Ogre","Chaos Renegade teams represent the real flotsam and jetsam of the Blood Bowl world, players so maladjusted that no coach worth their salt would let them play on their roster. They might be bitter rejects, inveterate cheats or blatant foulers. Many are outcasts expelled from established teams. Inevitably, such players end up rejecting the ways of Nuffle and dedicating themselves to other dark powers, often garnering themselves all manner of dubious mutations as ‘rewards’ in the process. The most successful team of this type was the Chaos All-Stars, whose eccentrically mixed line-up managed to soar to glory. Also of note is the (in)famous Mongrel Horde, a motley assortment of scumbags in it for the gold. Unfortunately, most of the Horde’s players hate each other, often refusing to play nicely or turn up to practices together!",BB2020
Dark Elf,1,50000,TRUE,Elven Kingdoms League,all_of=[Elven Kingdoms League],,"Thousands of years ago, the Dark Elves were little more than a small group within High Elf society who turned their back on traditional Elven ways. They eschewed nobility and grace for power and glory, believing their immortality marked them out as the most powerful of all the world’s races. Their thirst for conquest led to a bitter civil war that rocked the Elven kingdoms. Dark Elf teams exhibit similar strengths and weaknesses to their Elven cousins, but are distinctly more aggressive in their game. But sheer spite makes the Dark Elves enjoy the running game, particularly when a team includes a remarkable player like Jeremiah Kool. In fact, it is hard to believe that the Flashing Blade won’t be tempted out of retirement – if not by the Darkside Cowboys, then by some other team.",BB2020
Dwarf,1,50000,TRUE,"Old World Classic, Worlds Edge Superleague","all_of=[Old World Classic, Worlds Edge Superleague]",,"Dwarfs were one of the very first races to play Blood Bowl and many Dwarf teams can trace their history to the early years of the game. Dwarfs tend to use a running game, grinding their opponents into the ground as they go and working on the principle of high casualty rates opening up the field. There are so many Dwarf teams around that it is possible to find one to champion almost any style of play. It is, however, the Dwarfs’ reputation for flamboyant illegality that makes them such a big hit with the fans. Since it was a Dwarf, now immortalised by the name Roze-El, who first translated Nuffle’s sacred laws and brought the game into being, most Dwarf teams believe they have a lasting right to alter the laws as they choose.",BB2020
Elven Union,2,50000,TRUE,Elven Kingdoms League,all_of=[Elven Kingdoms League],,"Following the collapse of the NAF, many Elven teams found themselves indebted to noble backers from the Elven kingdoms, who – thanks to a lot of small print – began to make their way onto the pitch, shunting established players to the sidelines. Outrage abounded among players and fans alike, and it was only a matter of time before something was done about it. When that something finally happened, the formation of the Elven Union came as a surprise to no one. A loose federation of Elven teams, made up primarily of High Elf players but including the odd Wood Elf and even Dark Elf, the Union seeks to repair the damaged reputation of Elven teams and show that they can take Blood Bowl seriously. What the teams lack in funding, they make up for with experience and stubborn determination.",BB2020
Goblin,3,60000,TRUE,"Badlands Brawl, Bribery and Corruption, Underworld Challenge","all_of=[Badlands Brawl, Bribery and Corruption, Underworld Challenge]",,"Goblins are cruel and uncouth, with a juvenile sense of humour and a wicked imagination dedicated to discovering new ways of hurting others without getting hurt themselves. This tends to make them better Blood Bowl fans than players, and indeed Goblin fans have a solid reputation throughout the Old World for turning up hours before the game, getting drunk, starting fights, singing lewd and insulting songs, and generally causing trouble wherever they go. Unsurprisingly, Goblin teams don’t tend to do amazingly well on the pitch, but by Nuffle are they entertaining! Their play style revolves around a seemingly endless arsenal of ‘secret’ weapons which the Gobbos sneak onto the pitch at every opportunity, and the assistance of lumbering Trolls who alternate between flinging their smaller team-mates up the pitch and absent-mindedly chewing on them instead!",BB2020
Halfling,3,60000,TRUE,"Halfling Thimble Cup, Old World Classic","all_of=[Halfling Thimble Cup, Old World Classic]",,"The technical deficiency of Halfling teams is legendary. They’re too short to throw or catch, they run at half pace, and it goes without saying that their blocking game leaves something to be desired. Most Halfling coaches, aware of the material that they have to work with, make up for quality with quantity. After all, if you can get half a dozen players in the opposing team’s End Zone and, by some miracle, manage to end up with the ball, then there is a small chance that one or two of them won’t be jelly by the time you throw the thing! Probably the only real point in the Halflings’ favour is their long-held alliance with the Treemen who guard the forests of their realm, and a team that can tempt one (or two!) of them along to a game suddenly doesn’t look so pathetic!",BB2020
Human,1,50000,TRUE,Old World Classic,all_of=[Old World Classic],,"Professional Human players are widely considered to be the best all-round Blood Bowl players in the Old World. What they may lack in the sheer strength of the Orcs, the agility of the High Elves, the toughness of the Dwarfs, the frenzy of the Dark Elves, or the speed of the Skaven, they make up for in sheer grit and determination! More importantly, they do not suffer the weaknesses commonly associated with any of these players. For example, where Dwarfs are tough, they are also slow, Humans by contrast are hardy and relatively quick, and whilst Skaven are very quick, they are not as brave as Humans. It is hardly surprising then that Humans account for over half of all Blood Bowl players – counting Skeletons, Ghouls and Vampires playing for Undead teams, and mutants playing for Chaos teams!",BB2020
Imperial Nobility,2,70000,TRUE,Old World Classic,all_of=[Old World Classic],,"It is quite the norm that Blood Bowl teams are privately owned, but where the majority of teams are owned by proprietors and coaches who run their teams as professional outfits, there are plenty of other teams that exist for other reasons. Rich nobles, eager entrepreneurs, crime lords with large sums of cash to hide from treasury men who ask bothersome questions, all these and more are drawn to the sport. Some are lured by the presence of vast wealth and long to liberate it from its current owners and keep it safe with their existing fortunes. Others are eager fans to whom the idea of owning a famous Blood Bowl team is a fantasy they can afford to pursue. Some such fortunate fans take it a step further and build teams to live out their dreams of becoming famous players themselves!",Spike 12
Lizardmen,1,70000,TRUE,Lustrian Superleague,all_of=[Lustrian Superleague],,"If Blood Bowl historians are to be believed, Lizardmen have been playing the sport for over 8000 years. This does seem a little unlikely but when questioned, Blood Bowl historians just nod smugly, peer over their spectacles and say that this just goes to show how prescient Lizardmen are. Whatever the story behind their involvement in the sport, they’ve definitely made an impact! On the field, Lizardmen epitomise teamwork, with up to four different species working together on the pitch at a time. Skinks are the most numerous players, highly agile and as quick as lightning. They are balanced out by Saurus, fewer in number and not as fast, but capable of dishing out some serious punishment. Then there are the Kroxigor, reptilian monstrosities capable of felling an Ogre with a single blow!",BB2020
Necromantic Horror,2,70000,FALSE,"Masters of Undeath, Sylvanian Spotlight","all_of=[Masters of Undeath, Sylvanian Spotlight]",,"The dead do not rest easy. From haunted castles to sinister forests, Undead creatures prowl the night, snatching unwary villagers from their beds. Well, some of them do. For the rest, there’s Blood Bowl! Many Necromancers, proficient at corpse-raising and flesh-crafting but lacking a real plan of how to use their skills, realise that warm dugouts are a lovely alternative to musty tombs and dank barrows, and therefore decide to assemble a team of players (quite literally!). Interestingly, a schism of sorts seems to have occurred, leading to two competing philosophies when it comes to coaching an Undead team. Some Necromancers put their trust in the ancient dead. Other Necromancers prefer a little more life in their team, buying the services of Werewolves with promises of fresh meat and stitching together hulking Flesh Golems from an assortment of cadavers.",Spike 11
Nurgle,2,70000,FALSE,Favoured of Nurgle,all_of=[Favoured of Nurgle],,"The followers of Chaos have been involved in Blood Bowl since the earliest days of the sport. Although most teams started as a conglomerate of followers of all of the Chaos gods, it didn’t take long for teams to be more selective in their choice of deity. On the field, Nurgle teams are a terrifying prospect to face. What they lack in agility and coordination, they more than make up for with brute strength, a natural resilience to harm and a whole playbook of stomach-churning tactics devised to bring the other team to its knees. Nurgle teams defy conventional definition, being made up of Rotters, players who have contracted one or more of Nurgle’s many blessings; Bloaters, players swollen with disease; Pestigors, Beastmen attracted to the smell; and Rotspawn, players so blessed by the Plague God that they have devolved into hideously mutated beasts.",BB2020
Ogre,3,70000,TRUE,"Badlands Brawl, Low Cost Linemen, Old World Classic","all_of=[Badlands Brawl, Low Cost Linemen, Old World Classic]",,"At face value, the thought of an Ogre Blood Bowl team is enough to fill most players with dread. Thankfully, the reality never quite lives up to their worst fears. For starters, most Ogres are incredibly dense. Just getting them to all turn up at the same time is a mammoth task. Not to mention that very few coaches can afford to field more than a few Ogres at a time, meaning that most Ogre teams are bulked out with Gnoblars. Then there’s the fact that, no matter how much you train them, the moment the whistle goes, most Ogres forget everything and try to pound their opponents into a bloody mess. Coaches who know what they’re doing can turn this to their advantage, but it’s a rare sight to see an Ogre team performing consistently.",BB2020
Old World Alliance,1,70000,TRUE,Old World Classic,all_of=[Old World Classic],"An Old World Alliance team may include a single Big Guy, chosen from among the following: Ogre, or Altern Forest Treeman","The cities of the Old World are bustling metropoles, populated by all manner of different races. From Kislev in the cold north, to Estalia in the sweltering south, Humans build their homes, and to these flock Dwarfs, Halflings and more. Many Dwarfs come to build the tall towers and maintain the high walls of these great cities, whilst Halflings come to cook, eat and steal any small items they happen upon. Indeed, in these more enlightened times when warfare is considered a thing of the past, ever more varied races flock to these urban centres, so that today even Ogres are an increasingly common sight. Old World Alliance teams, though relatively uncommon, tend to form in the largest of cities, where cosmopolitan players of various races are drawn together to enjoy Nuffle’s great game.",BB2020
Orc,1,60000,TRUE,Badlands Brawl,all_of=[Badlands Brawl],,"Orcs have been playing Blood Bowl since the game was discovered – in fact it was an Orc who found the shrine where the sacred Tome of Nuffle was hidden. Orc teams are very hard-hitting, concentrating on pounding the opposition into the turf to create gaps through which Orc Blitzers can run. Indeed, if any fault can be found with Orc teams, it is that if they aren’t fighting amongst themselves, they’re spending too much time beating up the other team! Orcs have always respected brawn over intelligence, so their line of scrimmage is often overloaded with Big Uns and Troll players, adding even more weight to the front line. The Orc race also has close ties with other Greenskin races such as Goblins, and it is common to find such players in Orc teams.",BB2020
Shambling Undead,1,70000,FALSE,"Masters of Undeath, Sylvanian Spotlight","all_of=[Masters of Undeath, Sylvanian Spotlight]",,"The first Shambling Undead teams took to the gridiron a mere half century ago, and it has taken much of that time for the Undead to become accepted by the establishment. Today, they are a popular sight on the pitch. Fans love to see the reanimated dead shambling about, oblivious to all but the most debilitating of injuries, even as they dish out punishment to the opposition! Be it dry as dust Skeletons, their marionette movements mocking the living, or fresh Zombies, their moans and groans echoing around the pitch, accompanied by the fans' laughter at their awkward and stilted movements. Or from enraged Mummies, their unearthly roars of anger setting pulses racing, to sinister Ghouls stalking the wide zones, eyeing the crowds hungrily, Undead teams are a feast of sensations for eager fans!",BB2020
Skaven,1,50000,TRUE,Underworld Challenge,all_of=[Underworld Challenge],,"The game of Blood Bowl has become very popular in all walks of Skaven life. True to their warped nature, the Skaven have adapted the game in their own special ways. A new clan has been formed to govern and control the game – Clan Rigens – which consists of over 20 teams. The most famous are the Skavenblight Scramblers, twice winners of the Blood Bowl trophy. Several other teams have achieved successes in other, lesser leagues and competitions too, and there are mixed teams with a large proportion of Skaven competing at various levels. Of course, their close association with warpstone and the resulting mutations have helped with this success, but even the basic Skaven player has a lot going for them. It’s only a matter of time before a Skaven team makes it to the top again!",BB2020
Snotling,3,60000,TRUE,"Bribery and Corruption, Low Cost Linemen, Underworld Challenge","all_of=[Bribery and Corruption, Low Cost Linemen, Underworld Challenge]",,"Snotlings are the smallest, and perhaps the most numerous, type of Greenskin in the world. Tiny in stature and severely lacking any sense of self-preservation, they are enthusiastic followers and players of Blood Bowl. They sometimes appear in Ogre teams, but Snotlings are often unwilling to take to the field alongside other races, believing as they so often do in self-perpetuating myths of their own superiority. Such Snotlings swarm together around a visionary coach in great numbers and take to the pitch in a frenzy of enthusiasm. Officials hate to see Snotling teams, for various reasons, chief amongst which is that Snotlings can’t (or, more correctly, won’t) count and their ridiculously tiny stature makes them nigh impossible to manage as they flood onto the pitch!",BB2020
Underworld Denizens,2,70000,TRUE,"Bribery and Corruption, Underworld Challenge","all_of=[Bribery and Corruption, Underworld Challenge]","An Underworld Denizens team may include a single Big Guy, chosen from among the following: Underworld Troll, or Mutant Rat Ogre","Ask any Goblinoid and they’ll tell you that it’s not easy being a low-down sneaky git! Similarly, if you managed to corner a Skaven long enough to get an answer out of them, they’d probably tell you that living in the sewers is less fun than it looks. It’s not entirely clear when these very different races first joined forces, but there’s a good chance that the Underworld Creepers were the first such team to take to the pitch. Fuelled by a heady elixir of warpstone- infused mushrooms, Underworld Denizens teams combine the sneakiness of Snotlings and Goblins with the speed of Skaven; most are despised, but some of them have garnered a cult following! The most popular tend to be those who field a Troll or Rat Ogre, hideous and pallid mountains of slab-like muscle that serve as enforcers for their smaller team-mates.",BB2020
Wood Elf,1,50000,TRUE,Elven Kingdoms League,all_of=[Elven Kingdoms League],,"Wood Elves make natural Blood Bowl players, although their refusal to wear heavy armour does leave them vulnerable to some of the more hard hitting teams. Generally, the Wood Elves’ natural athletic ability is enough to keep them out of trouble – it takes a fast or cunning foe to catch a Wood Elf player. In any case, no decent Wood Elf wants to wear bulky, shapeless armour, let alone be seen in it! For Wood Elves the long pass is everything, even more so than for their High Elf cousins, and all of their effort goes into becoming experts at throwing or receiving. The one exception to this is the Wood Elf Wardancers. These athletic warriors are trained in the deadly arts of hand-to-hand combat and are a match for almost any foe.",BB2020
Chaos Dwarf,1,70000,TRUE,"Badlands Brawl, Favoured of Hashut","all_of=[Badlands Brawl, Favoured of Hashut]",,"The Chaos Dwarfs of the Dark Lands have spent many years on the fringes of the Blood Bowl world thanks to the NAF banning many of them from official play (I'm still not sure what rule we broke... - Ed). However, since the collapse of the sport's governing body, Chaos Dwarf teams have been sighted more regularly in competitions across the known world and have been performing rather well!",Spike 18
Amazon,1,60000,TRUE,Lustrian Superleague,all_of=[Lustrian Superleague],,"Little is known about the mystical warrior women of the Lustrian jungles, with legend and myth often recounted far more than fact. When they are not guarding their secret jungle temples from prying outsiders, the Amazons enjoy Blood Bowl a s much as anyone. In this issue of Spike! Journal, we explore the sweltering brush of Lustria's rainforests t o learn more about these mysterious Blood Bowl players and find out why fans from every corner of the world love watching the Amazons go to work on the gridiron.",Spike 15

It's fair to say that, in the eyes of those who call the Empire their home, the Norscans may not be seen as comparatively, if at all, civilised - fond as they are of their beer and the odd spot of raiding every now and then. But if there is one thing that Norscans do very well, it's delivering their own hard-hitting brand of Blood Bowl!",Spike 14
Gnome,3,50000,TRUE,Halfling Thimble Cup,all_of=[Halfling Thimble Cup],,"Gnomes are something of an enigma in the world of Blood Bowl, with many fans having dismissed their existence almost entirely! In this issue of Spike! Journal,we venture into the mysterious forests and dimly lit caves of the Gnomish lands for the very first time as we shed some light on these diminutive deceivers. Gnomes areactually quite fond of a game of Blood Bowl– though it’s fair to say that their tactics (and woodland allies) are somewhat unorthodox!",Spike 17
Khorne,2,60000,TRUE,Favoured of Khorne,all_of=[Favoured of Khorne],,"They say that the most important thing in a game of Blood Bowl is the ball. Well, not if you ask those teams that have devoted themselves to Khorne. To them, it's the first word of Nuffle's sacred game that is the most important - blood! In this issue, Spike! Journal takes a look at the recent resurgence of teams dedicated to the Blood God, and wades through the vast amounts of blood, gore and viscera they create to get the inside scoop on Khorne teams.",Spike 13
High Elf,2,50000,TRUE,Elven Kingdoms League,all_of=[Elven Kingdoms League],,"When Blood Bowl was first played, High Elves disdained the game. They believed there was no more to Blood Bowl than two teams of uncivilised yobs pummelling each other senseless in a display of mindless violence. It didn’t take them long, however, to realise that there was far more to it than that. High Elf teams are renowned for their passing game. They have many advantages when it comes to winning (as opposed to slaughtering the opposition, which isn’t always the same thing…), and their fine players are the epitome of the more graceful side of the game. The only real problem with High Elf teams is that they can be very picky about who, when or where they play, so we must be thankful they deign to play lesser races at all!",Team of Legend
Tomb Kings,2,70000,FALSE,Sylvanian Spotlight,all_of=[Sylvanian Spotlight],,"Once upon a time, Undead teams were few and far between, but that’s not the case these days. Relative newcomers to the sport, Tomb Kings teams hail from the scorching deserts far to the south, and travel from game to game on great barges that are bedecked with all the finery of their ancient kingdoms. Each team is led by a liche priest, an ancient wizard who holds the team together, quite literally, as well as fulfilling all the normal roles you’d expect from a head coach. The team itself is mostly made up of the Skeletons of long-dead players who were sealed into the tombs alongside their deceased sponsors in millennia past, fulfilling the terms of their eternal contracts, rounded out with mighty Tomb Guardians, dauntless revenants who are an utter terror in the midfield.",Team of Legend
