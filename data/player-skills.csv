Additionally, this player may reduce any negative modifier applied to the Agility test when they attempt to Jump over a Prone or Stunned player, or to Leap over an empty square or a square occupied by a Standing player by 1, to a minimum of -1.

A player with this Skill cannot also have the Pogo Stick trait.",,

If the total is higher than the target’s Strength characteristic, this player increases their Strength characteristic to be equal to that of the target of the Block action, before counting offensive or defensive assists, for the duration of this Block action.

1-3,5,Frenzy,General,"Every time this player performs a Block action (on its own or as part of a Blitz action), they must follow-up if the target is pushed back and if they are able. If the target is still Standing after being pushed back, and if this player was able to follow-up, this player must then perform a second Block action against the same target, again following-up if the target is pushed back.

If this player is performing a Blitz action, performing a second Block action will also cost them one square of their Movement Allowance. If this player has no Movement Allowance left to perform a second Block action, they must Rush to do so. If they cannot Rush, they cannot perform a second Block action.

Note that if an opposition player in possession of the ball is pushed back into your End Zone and is still Standing, a touchdown will be scored, ending the drive. In this case, the second Block action is not performed.

If the result is 6 or higher, or if the roll is a natural 6, this player may immediately move into the square vacated by the opposition player (this player does not need to Dodge to make this move). If, however, the result is 5 or lower, or if the roll is a natural 1, this Skill has no further effect.

4-5,3,Strip Ball,General,"When this player targets an opposition player that is in possession of the ball with a Block action (on its own or as part of a Blitz action), choosing to apply a Push Back result will cause that player to drop the ball in the square they are pushed back into. The ball will bounce from the square the player is pushed back into, as if they had been Knocked Down.",,

4-5,2,Multiple Block,Strength,"When this player performs a Block action on its own (but not as part of a Blitz action), they may choose to perform two Block actions, each targeting a different player they are Marking. However, doing so will reduce this player’s Strength characteristic by 2 for the duration of this activation. Both Block actions are performed simultaneously, meaning both are resolved in full even if one or both result in a Turnover. The dice rolls for each Block action should be kept separate to avoid confusion. This player cannot follow-up when using this Skill.

Note that choosing to use this Skill means this player will be unable to use the Frenzy skill during the same activation.",,
4-5,3,Pile Driver,Strength,"When an opposition player is Knocked Down by this player as the result of a Block action (on its own or as part of a Blitz action), this player may immediately commit a free Foul action against the Knocked Down player.
